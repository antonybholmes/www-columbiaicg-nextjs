      "title": "FATC Domain Deletion Compromises ATM Protein Stability, Blocks Lymphocyte Development, and Promotes Lymphomagenesis",
      "abstract": "Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase is a master regulator of the DNA damage response, and loss of ATM leads to primary immunodeficiency and greatly increased risk for lymphoid malignancies. The FATC domain is conserved in phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-related protein kinases (PIKKs). Truncation mutation in the FATC domain (R3047X) selectively compromised reactive oxygen species-induced ATM activation in cell-free assays. In this article, we show that in mouse models, knock-in ATM-R3057X mutation (Atm\u2060 \nRX\n \u2060, corresponding to R3047X in human ATM) severely compromises ATM protein stability and causes T cell developmental defects, B cell Ig class-switch recombination defects, and infertility resembling ATM-null. The residual ATM-R3057X protein retains minimal yet functional measurable DNA damage-induced checkpoint activation and significantly delays lymphomagenesis in Atm\u2060 \nRX/RX\n \u2060 mice compared with Atm\u2060 \n-/-\n \u2060. Together, these results support a physiological role of the FATC domain in ATM protein stability and show that the presence of minimal residual ATM-R3057X protein can prevent growth retardation and delay tumorigenesis without restoring lymphocyte development and fertility.",

      "title": "CtIP-mediated DNA resection is dispensable for IgH class switch recombination by alternative end-joining",
      "abstract": "To generate antibodies with different effector functions, B cells undergo Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain (IgH) class switch recombination (CSR). The ligation step of CSR is usually mediated by the classical nonhomologous end-joining (cNHEJ) pathway. In cNHEJ-deficient cells, a remarkable \u223c25% of CSR can be achieved by the alternative end-joining (Alt-EJ) pathway that preferentially uses microhomology (MH) at the junctions. While A-EJ-mediated repair of endonuclease-generated breaks requires DNA end resection, we show that CtIP-mediated DNA end resection is dispensable for A-EJ-mediated CSR using cNHEJ-deficient B cells. High-throughput sequencing analyses revealed that loss of ATM/ATR phosphorylation of CtIP at T855 or ATM kinase inhibition suppresses resection without altering the MH pattern of the A-EJ-mediated switch junctions. Moreover, we found that ATM kinase promotes Alt-EJ-mediated CSR by suppressing interchromosomal translocations independent of end resection. Finally, temporal analyses reveal that MHs are enriched in early internal deletions even in cNHEJ-proficient B cells. Thus, we propose that repetitive IgH switch regions represent favored substrates for MH-mediated end-joining contributing to the robustness and resection independence of A-EJ-mediated CSR.",

      "title": "Clinical PARP inhibitors do not abrogate PARP1 exchange at DNA damage sites in vivo",
      "abstract": "DNA breaks recruit and activate PARP1/2, which deposit poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) to recruit XRCC1-Ligase3 and other repair factors to promote DNA repair. Clinical PARP inhibitors (PARPi) extend the lifetime of damage-induced PARP1/2 foci, referred to as 'trapping'. To understand the molecular nature of 'trapping' in cells, we employed quantitative live-cell imaging and fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching. Unexpectedly, we found that PARP1 exchanges rapidly at DNA damage sites even in the presence of clinical PARPi, suggesting the persistent foci are not caused by physical stalling. Loss of Xrcc1, a major downstream effector of PAR, also caused persistent PARP1 foci without affecting PARP1 exchange. Thus, we propose that the persistent PARP1 foci are formed by different PARP1 molecules that are continuously recruited to and exchanging at DNA lesions due to attenuated XRCC1-LIG3 recruitment and delayed DNA repair. Moreover, mutation analyses of the NAD+ interacting residues of PARP1 showed that PARP1 can be physically trapped at DNA damage sites, and identified H862 as a potential regulator for PARP1 exchange. PARP1-H862D, but not PARylation-deficient PARP1-E988K, formed stable PARP1 foci upon activation. Together, these findings uncovered the nature of persistent PARP1 foci and identified NAD+ interacting residues involved in the PARP1 exchange.",

      "abstract": "The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which is composed of the KU heterodimer and the large catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), is a classical nonhomologous end-joining (cNHEJ) factor. Na\u00efve B cells undergo class switch recombination (CSR) to generate antibodies with different isotypes by joining two DNA double-strand breaks at different switching regions via the cNHEJ pathway. DNA-PK and the cNHEJ pathway play important roles in the DNA repair phase of CSR. To initiate cNHEJ, KU binds to DNA ends and recruits and activates DNA-PK. Activated DNA-PK phosphorylates DNA-PKcs at the S2056 and T2609 clusters. Loss of T2609 cluster phosphorylation increases radiation sensitivity but whether T2609 phosphorylation has a role in physiological DNA repair remains elusive. Using the DNA-PKcs\n5A\n mouse model carrying alanine substitutions at the T2609 cluster, here we show that loss of T2609 phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs does not affect the CSR efficiency. Yet, the CSR junctions recovered from DNA-PKcs\n5A/5A\n B cells reveal increased chromosomal translocations, extensive use of distal switch regions (consistent with end resection), and preferential usage of microhomology-all signs of the alternative end-joining pathway.

      "abstract": "The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which comprises the KU heterodimer and a catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), is a classical non-homologous end-joining (cNHEJ) factor1. KU binds to DNA ends, initiates cNHEJ, and recruits and activates DNA-PKcs. KU also binds to RNA, but the relevance of this interaction in mammals is unclear. Here we use mouse models to show that DNA-PK has an unexpected role in the biogenesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and in haematopoiesis. The expression of kinase-dead DNA-PKcs abrogates cNHEJ2. However, most mice that both expressed kinase-dead DNA-PKcs and lacked the tumour suppressor TP53 developed myeloid disease, whereas all other previously characterized mice deficient in both cNHEJ and TP53 expression succumbed to pro-B cell lymphoma3. DNA-PK autophosphorylates DNA-PKcs, which is its best characterized substrate. Blocking the phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at the T2609 cluster, but not the S2056 cluster, led to KU-dependent defects in 18S rRNA processing, compromised global protein synthesis in haematopoietic cells and caused bone marrow failure in mice. KU drives the assembly of DNA-PKcs on a wide range of cellular RNAs, including the U3 small nucleolar RNA, which is essential for processing of 18S rRNA4. U3 activates purified DNA-PK and triggers phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at T2609. DNA-PK, but not other cNHEJ factors, resides in nucleoli in an rRNA-dependent manner and is co-purified with the small subunit processome. Together our data show that DNA-PK has RNA-dependent, cNHEJ-independent functions during ribosome biogenesis that require the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs and its phosphorylation at the T2609 cluster.",

CtIP is an essential gene implicated in end resection and DNA repair. Here, we show that CtIP is essential for early B cell development but dispensable in naive B cells. CtIP loss is well tolerated in G1-arrested B cells and during V(D)J recombination, but in proliferating B cells, CtIP loss leads to a progressive cell death characterized by ATM hyperactivation, G2/M arrest, genomic instability, and 53BP1 nuclear body formation, indicating that the essential role of CtIP during proliferation underscores its stage-specific requirement in B cells. B cell proliferation requires phosphorylation of CtIP at T847 presumably by CDK, but not its interaction with CtBP or Rb or its nuclease activity. CtIP phosphorylation by ATM/ATR at T859 (T855 in mice) promotes end resection in G1-arrested cells but is dispensable for B cell development and class switch recombination, suggesting distinct roles for T859 and T847 phosphorylation in B cell development.",

      "abstract": "The classical nonhomologous end-joining (cNHEJ) pathway is a major DNA double-strand break repair pathway in mammalian cells and is required for lymphocyte development and maturation. The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a cNHEJ factor that encompasses the Ku70-Ku80 (KU) heterodimer and the large DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). In mouse models, loss of DNA-PKcs (DNA-PKcs-/- ) abrogates end processing (e.g., hairpin opening), but not end-ligation, whereas expression of the kinase-dead DNA-PKcs protein (DNA-PKcsKD/KD ) abrogates end-ligation, suggesting a kinase-dependent structural function of DNA-PKcs during cNHEJ. Lymphocyte development is abolished in DNA-PKcs-/- and DNA-PKcsKD/KD mice because of the requirement for both hairpin opening and end-ligation during V(D)J recombination. DNA-PKcs itself is the best-characterized substrate of DNA-PK. The S2056 cluster is the best-characterized autophosphorylation site in human DNA-PKcs. In this study, we show that radiation can induce phosphorylation of murine DNA-PKcs at the corresponding S2053. We also generated knockin mouse models with alanine- (DNA-PKcsPQR) or phospho-mimetic aspartate (DNA-PKcsSD) substitutions at the S2053 cluster. Despite moderate radiation sensitivity in the DNA-PKcsPQR/PQR fibroblasts and lymphocytes, both DNA-PKcsPQR/PQR and DNA-PKcsSD/SD mice retained normal kinase activity and underwent efficient V(D)J recombination and class switch recombination, indicating that phosphorylation at the S2053 cluster of murine DNA-PKcs (corresponding to S2056 of human DNA-PKcs), although important for radiation resistance, is dispensable for the end-ligation and hairpin-opening function of DNA-PK essential for lymphocyte development.",

      "abstract": "ATR kinase is activated by RPA-coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to orchestrate DNA damage responses. Here we show that ATR inhibition differs from ATR loss. Mouse model expressing kinase-dead ATR (Atr+/KD), but not loss of ATR (Atr+/-), displays ssDNA-dependent defects at the non-homologous region of X-Y chromosomes during male meiosis leading to sterility, and at telomeres, rDNA, and fragile sites during mitosis leading to lymphocytopenia. Mechanistically, we find that ATR kinase activity is necessary for the rapid exchange of ATR at DNA-damage-sites, which in turn promotes CHK1-phosphorylation. ATR-KD, but not loss of ATR, traps a subset of ATR and RPA on chromatin, where RPA is hyper-phosphorylated by ATM/DNA-PKcs and prevents downstream repair. Consequently, Atr+/KD cells have shorter inter-origin distances and are vulnerable to induced fork collapses, genome instability and mitotic catastrophe. These results reveal mechanistic differences between ATR inhibition and ATR loss, with implications for ATR signaling and cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "The catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) is a classical nonhomologous end-joining (cNHEJ) factor. Loss of DNA-PKcs diminished mature B cell class switch recombination (CSR) to other isotypes, but not IgG1. Here, we show that expression of the kinase-dead DNA-PKcs (DNA-PKcsKD/KD ) severely compromises CSR to IgG1. High-throughput sequencing analyses of CSR junctions reveal frequent accumulation of nonproductive interchromosomal translocations, inversions, and extensive end resection in DNA-PKcsKD/KD , but not DNA-PKcs\n-/-\n , B cells. Meanwhile, the residual joints from DNA-PKcs\nKD/KD\n cells and the efficient S\u00b5-S\u03b31 junctions from DNA-PKcs\n-/-\n B cells both display similar preferences for small (2-6 nt) microhomologies (MH). In DNA-PKcs\n-/-\n cells, S\u00b5-S\u03b31 joints are more resistant to inversions and extensive resection than S\u00b5-S\u03b5 and S\u00b5-S\u00b5 joints, providing a mechanism for the isotype-specific CSR defects. Together, our findings identify a kinase-dependent role of DNA-PKcs in suppressing MH-mediated end joining and a structural role of DNA-PKcs protein in the orientation of CSR.",

      "title": "PAXX promotes KU accumulation at DNA breaks and is essential for end-joining in XLF-deficient mice",
      "abstract": "Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is the most prominent DNA double strand break (DSB) repair pathway in mammalian cells. PAXX is the newest NHEJ factor, which shares structural similarity with known NHEJ factors-XRCC4 and XLF. Here we report that PAXX is dispensable for physiological NHEJ in otherwise wild-type mice. Yet Paxx-/- mice require XLF and Xlf-/- mice require PAXX for end-ligation. As such, Xlf-/-Paxx-/- mice display severe genomic instability and neuronal apoptosis, which eventually lead to embryonic lethality. Despite their structural similarities, only Xlf-/- cells, but not Paxx-/- cells require ATM/DNA-PK kinase activity for end-ligation. Mechanistically, PAXX promotes the accumulation of KU at DSBs, while XLF enhances LIG4 recruitment without affecting KU dynamics at DNA breaks in vivo. Together these findings identify the molecular functions of PAXX in KU accumulation at DNA ends and reveal distinct, yet critically complementary functions of PAXX and XLF during NHEJ.",
