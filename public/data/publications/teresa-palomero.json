      "abstract": "Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) constitute a highly heterogeneous group of hematological diseases with complex clinical and molecular features consistent with the diversity of the T-cell type from which they originate. In the past several years, the systematic implementation of high-throughput genomic technologies for the analysis of T-cell malignancies has supported an exponential progress in our understanding of the genetic drivers of oncogenesis and unraveled the molecular complexity of these diseases. Recent findings have helped redefine the classification of T-cell malignancies and provided novel biomarkers to improve diagnosis accuracy and analyze the response to therapy. In addition, multiple novel targeted therapies including small-molecule inhibitors, antibody-based approaches, and immunotherapy have shown promising results in early clinical analysis and have the potential to completely change the way T-cell malignancies have been treated traditionally.",

      "abstract": "Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) and peripheral T cell lymphoma not-otherwise-specified (PTCL, NOS) have poor prognosis and lack driver actionable targets for directed therapies in most cases. Here we identify FYN-TRAF3IP2 as a recurrent oncogenic gene fusion in AITL and PTCL, NOS tumors. Mechanistically, we show that FYN-TRAF3IP2 leads to aberrant NF-\u03baB signaling downstream of T cell receptor activation. Consistent with a driver oncogenic role, FYN-TRAF3IP2 expression in hematopoietic progenitors induces NF-\u03baB-driven T cell transformation in mice and cooperates with loss of the Tet2 tumor suppressor in PTCL development. Moreover, abrogation of NF-\u03baB signaling in FYN-TRAF3IP2-induced tumors with I\u03baB kinase inhibitors delivers strong anti-lymphoma effects in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate an oncogenic and pharmacologically targetable role for FYN-TRAF3IP2 in PTCLs and call for the clinical testing of anti-NF-\u03baB targeted therapies in these diseases.",

      "title": "Integration of transcriptional and mutational data simplifies the stratification of peripheral T-cell lymphoma",
      "abstract": "The histological diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) can represent a challenge, particularly in the case of closely related entities such as angioimmunoblastic T-lymphoma (AITL), PTCL-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), and ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). Although gene expression profiling and next generations sequencing have been proven to define specific features recurrently associated with distinct entities, genomic-based stratifications have not yet led to definitive diagnostic criteria and/or entered into the routine clinical practice. Herein, to improve the current molecular classification between AITL and PTCL-NOS, we analyzed the transcriptional profiles from 503 PTCLs stratified according to their molecular configuration and integrated them with genomic data of recurrently mutated genes (RHOA G17V , TET2, IDH2 R172 , and DNMT3A) in 53 cases (39 AITLs and 14 PTCL-NOSs) included in the series. Our analysis unraveled that the mutational status of RHOA G17V , TET2, and DNMT3A poorly correlated, individually, with peculiar transcriptional fingerprints. Conversely, in IDH2 R172 samples a strong transcriptional signature was identified that could act as a surrogate for mutational status. The integrated analysis of clinical, mutational, and molecular data led to a simplified 19-gene signature that retains high accuracy in differentiating the main nodal PTCL entities. The expression levels of those genes were confirmed in an independent cohort profiled by RNA-sequencing.",

      "abstract": "Angioimmunoblastic T\u00a0cell lymphoma (AITL) is an aggressive tumor derived from malignant transformation of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. AITL is characterized by loss-of-function mutations in Ten-Eleven Translocation 2 (TET2) epigenetic tumor suppressor and a highly recurrent mutation (p.Gly17Val) in the RHOA small GTPase. Yet, the specific role of RHOA G17V in AITL remains unknown. Expression of Rhoa G17V in CD4+ T\u00a0cells induces Tfh cell specification; increased proliferation associated with inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) upregulation and increased phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Moreover, RHOA G17V expression together with Tet2 loss resulted in development of AITL in mice. Importantly, Tet2-/-RHOA G17V tumor proliferation in\u00a0vivo can be inhibited by ICOS/PI3K-specific blockade, supporting a driving role for ICOS signaling in Tfh cell transformation.",

Using RNA sequencing and targeted sequencing, here we identify a recurrent in-frame deletion (VAV1 \u0394778-786) generated by a focal deletion-driven alternative splicing mechanism as well as novel VAV1 gene fusions (VAV1-THAP4, VAV1-MYO1F, and VAV1-S100A7) in PTCL. Mechanistically these genetic lesions result in increased activation of VAV1 catalytic-dependent (MAPK, JNK) and non-catalytic-dependent (nuclear factor of activated T cells, NFAT) VAV1 effector pathways. These results support a driver oncogenic role for VAV1 signaling in the pathogenesis of PTCL.",

      "title": "Mutational landscape, clonal evolution patterns, and role of RAS mutations in relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia",
      "abstract": "Although multiagent combination chemotherapy is curative in a significant fraction of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, 20% of cases relapse and most die because of chemorefractory disease. Here we used whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing to analyze the mutational landscape at relapse in pediatric ALL cases. These analyses identified numerous relapse-associated mutated genes intertwined in chemotherapy resistance-related protein complexes. In this context, RAS-MAPK pathway-activating mutations in the neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), and protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) genes were present in 24 of 55 (44%) cases in our series. Interestingly, some leukemias showed retention or emergence of RAS mutant clones at relapse, whereas in others RAS mutant clones present at diagnosis were replaced by RAS wild-type populations, supporting a role for both positive and negative selection evolutionary pressures in clonal evolution of RAS-mutant leukemia. Consistently, functional dissection of mouse and human wild-type and mutant RAS isogenic leukemia cells demonstrated induction of methotrexate resistance but also improved the response to vincristine in mutant RAS-expressing lymphoblasts. These results highlight the central role of chemotherapy-driven selection as a central mechanism of leukemia clonal evolution in relapsed ALL, and demonstrate a previously unrecognized dual role of RAS mutations as drivers of both sensitivity and resistance to chemotherapy.",

Here we performed whole-exome sequencing of tumor-normal sample pairs from 25 patients with S\u00e9zary syndrome and 17 patients with other CTCLs. These analyses identified a distinctive pattern of somatic copy number alterations in S\u00e9zary syndrome, including highly prevalent chromosomal deletions involving the TP53, RB1, PTEN, DNMT3A and CDKN1B tumor suppressors. Mutation analysis identified a broad spectrum of somatic mutations in key genes involved in epigenetic regulation (TET2, CREBBP, KMT2D (MLL2), KMT2C (MLL3), BRD9, SMARCA4 and CHD3) and signaling, including MAPK1, BRAF, CARD11 and PRKG1 mutations driving increased MAPK, NF-\u03baB and NFAT activity upon T cell receptor stimulation. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the genetics of S\u00e9zary syndrome and CTCL and support the development of personalized therapies targeting key oncogenically activated signaling pathways for the treatment of these diseases.

      "abstract": "Efforts to identify and annotate cancer driver genetic lesions have been focused primarily on the analysis of protein-coding genes; however, most genetic abnormalities found in human cancer are located in intergenic regions. Here we identify a new long range-acting MYC enhancer controlled by NOTCH1 that is targeted by recurrent chromosomal duplications in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). This highly conserved regulatory element, hereby named N-Me for NOTCH MYC enhancer, is located within a broad super-enhancer region +1.47 Mb from the MYC transcription initiating site, interacts with the MYC proximal promoter and induces orientation-independent MYC expression in reporter assays. Moreover, analysis of N-Me knockout mice demonstrates a selective and essential role of this regulatory element during thymocyte development and in NOTCH1-induced T-ALL. Together these results identify N-Me as a long-range oncogenic enhancer implicated directly in the pathogenesis of human leukemia and highlight the importance of the NOTCH1-MYC regulatory axis in T cell transformation and as a therapeutic target in T-ALL.

      "abstract": "Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a heterogeneous and poorly understood group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Here we combined whole-exome sequencing of 12 tumor-normal DNA pairs, RNA sequencing analysis and targeted deep sequencing to identify new genetic alterations in PTCL transformation. These analyses identified highly recurrent epigenetic factor mutations in TET2, DNMT3A and IDH2 as well as a new highly prevalent RHOA mutation encoding a p.Gly17Val alteration present in 22 of 35 (67%) angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) samples and in 8 of 44 (18%) PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) samples. Mechanistically, the RHOA Gly17Val protein interferes with RHOA signaling in biochemical and cellular assays, an effect potentially mediated by the sequestration of activated guanine-exchange factor (GEF) proteins. In addition, we describe new and recurrent, albeit less frequent, genetic defects including mutations in FYN, ATM, B2M and CD58 implicating SRC signaling, impaired DNA damage response and escape from immune surveillance mechanisms in the pathogenesis of PTCL.

      "abstract": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive hematological tumor resulting from the malignant transformation of lymphoid progenitors. Despite intensive chemotherapy, 20% of pediatric patients and over 50% of adult patients with ALL do not achieve a complete remission or relapse after intensified chemotherapy, making disease relapse and resistance to therapy the most substantial challenge in the treatment of this disease. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identify mutations in the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene (NT5C2), which encodes a 5'-nucleotidase enzyme that is responsible for the inactivation of nucleoside-analog chemotherapy drugs, in 20/103 (19%) relapse T cell ALLs and 1/35 (3%) relapse B-precursor ALLs. NT5C2 mutant proteins show increased nucleotidase activity in vitro and conferred resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine when expressed in ALL lymphoblasts. These results support a prominent role for activating mutations in NT5C2 and increased nucleoside-analog metabolism in disease progression and chemotherapy resistance in ALL.",

Here we used reverse engineering of global transcriptional networks to decipher the oncogenic regulatory circuit controlled by TLX1 and TLX3. This systems biology analysis defined T cell leukemia homeobox 1 (TLX1) and TLX3 as master regulators of an oncogenic transcriptional circuit governing T-ALL. Notably, a network structure analysis of this hierarchical network identified RUNX1 as a key mediator of the T-ALL induced by TLX1 and TLX3 and predicted a tumor-suppressor role for RUNX1 in T cell transformation. Consistent with these results, we identified recurrent somatic loss-of-function mutations in RUNX1 in human T-ALL. Overall, these results place TLX1 and TLX3 at the top of an oncogenic transcriptional network controlling leukemia development, show the power of network analyses to identify key elements in the regulatory circuits governing human cancer and identify RUNX1 as a tumor-suppressor gene in T-ALL.",

However, the specific mechanisms of T cell transformation downstream of TLX1 remain to be elucidated. Here we show that transgenic expression of human TLX1 in mice induces T-ALL with frequent deletions and mutations in Bcl11b (encoding B cell leukemia/lymphoma-11B) and identify the presence of recurrent mutations and deletions in BCL11B in 16% of human T-ALLs. Most notably, mouse TLX1 tumors were typically aneuploid and showed a marked defect in the activation of the mitotic checkpoint. Mechanistically, TLX1 directly downregulates the expression of CHEK1 (encoding CHK1 checkpoint homolog) and additional mitotic control genes and induces loss of the mitotic checkpoint in nontransformed preleukemic thymocytes. These results identify a previously unrecognized mechanism contributing to chromosomal missegregation and aneuploidy active at the earliest stages of tumor development in the pathogenesis of cancer.",

Notably, PHF6 mutations are almost exclusively found in T-ALL samples from male subjects.

      "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms involved in disease progression and relapse in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) are poorly understood. We used single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis to analyze paired diagnostic and relapsed T-ALL samples to identify recurrent genetic alterations in T-ALL. This analysis showed that diagnosis and relapsed cases have common genetic alterations, but also that relapsed samples frequently lose chromosomal markers present at diagnosis, suggesting that relapsed T-ALL emerges from an ancestral clone different from the major leukemic population at diagnosis. In addition, we identified deletions and associated mutations in the WT1 tumor suppressor gene in 2 of 9 samples. Subsequent analysis showed WT1 mutations in 28 of 211 (13.2%) of pediatric and 10 of 85 (11.7%) of adult T-ALL cases. WT1 mutations present in T-ALL are predominantly heterozygous frameshift mutations resulting in truncation of the C-terminal zinc finger domains of this transcription factor. WT1 mutations are most prominently found in T-ALL cases with aberrant rearrangements of the oncogenic TLX1, TLX3, and HOXA transcription factor oncogenes. Survival analysis demonstrated that WT1 mutations do not confer adverse prognosis in pediatric and adult T-ALL. Overall, these results identify the presence of WT1 mutations as a recurrent genetic alteration in T-ALL.",

      "abstract": "ChIP-on-chip has emerged as a powerful tool to dissect the complex network of regulatory interactions between transcription factors and their targets. However, most ChIP-on-chip analysis methods use conservative approaches aimed at minimizing false-positive transcription factor targets. We present a model with improved sensitivity in detecting binding events from ChIP-on-chip data. Its application to human T cells, followed by extensive biochemical validation, reveals that 3 oncogenic transcription factors, NOTCH1, MYC, and HES1, bind to several thousand target gene promoters, up to an order of magnitude increase over conventional analysis methods. Gene expression profiling upon NOTCH1 inhibition shows broad-scale functional regulation across the entire range of predicted target genes, establishing a closer link between occupancy and regulation. Finally, the increased sensitivity reveals a combinatorial regulatory program in which MYC cobinds to virtually all NOTCH1-bound promoters. Overall, these results suggest an unappreciated complexity of transcriptional regulatory networks and highlight the fundamental importance of genome-scale analysis to represent transcriptional programs.",

However, limited antileukemic cytotoxicity and severe gastrointestinal toxicity have restricted the clinical application of these targeted drugs. Here we show that combination therapy with GSIs plus glucocorticoids can improve the antileukemic effects of GSIs and reduce their gut toxicity in vivo. Inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling in glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL restored glucocorticoid receptor autoupregulation and induced apoptotic cell death through induction of the gene encoding BCL-2-like apoptosis initiator-11 (BCL2L11). GSI treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest and accumulation of goblet cells in the gut mediated by upregulation of the gene encoding the transcription factor Kr\u00fcppel-like factor-4 (Klf4), a negative regulator of the cell cycle required for goblet cell differentiation. In contrast, glucocorticoid treatment induced transcriptional upregulation of cyclin D2 (Ccnd2) and protected mice from developing the intestinal goblet cell metaplasia typically induced by inhibition of NOTCH signaling with GSIs. These results support a role for glucocorticoids plus GSIs in the treatment of glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL.",

Here we report a novel class of activating mutations in NOTCH1 leading to aberrant activation of NOTCH1 signaling in T-cell lymphoblasts. These so-called juxtamembrane expansion (JME) alleles consist of internal duplication insertions in the vicinity of exon 28 of the NOTCH1 gene encoding the extracellular juxtamembrane region of the receptor. Notably, structure-function analysis of leukemia-derived and synthetic JME mutants demonstrated that the aberrant activation of NOTCH1 signaling is dependent on the number of residues introduced in the extracellular juxtamembrane region of the receptor and not on the specific amino acid sequence of these insertions. JME NOTCH1 mutants are effectively blocked by gamma-secretase inhibitors and require an intact metalloprotease cleavage site for activation. Overall, these results show a novel mechanism of NOTCH1 activation in T-ALL and provide further insight on the mechanisms that control the activation of NOTCH1 signaling.",

      "abstract": "Activating mutations in NOTCH1 are the most prominent genetic abnormality in T-cell acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) and inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling with gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) has been proposed as targeted therapy in this disease. However, most T-ALL cell lines with mutations in NOTCH1 fail to respond to GSI therapy. Using gene expression profiling and mutation analysis we showed that mutational loss of PTEN is a common event in T-ALL and is associated with resistance to NOTCH inhibition. Furthermore, our studies revealed that NOTCH1 induces upregulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway via HES1, which negatively controls the expression of PTEN. This regulatory circuitry is evolutionary conserved from Drosophila to humans as demonstrated by the interaction of overexpression of Delta and Akt in a model of Notch-induced transformation in the fly eye. Loss of PTEN and constitutive activation of AKT in T-ALL induce increased glucose metabolism and bypass the requirement of NOTCH1 signaling to sustain cell growth. Importantly, PTEN-null/GSI resistant T-ALL cells switch their oncogene addiction from NOTCH1 to AKT and are highly sensitive to AKT inhibitors. These results should facilitate the development of molecular therapies targeting NOTCH1 and AKT for the treatment of T-ALL.",

Here we show that NOTCH1 regulates the expression of PTEN (encoding phosphatase and tensin homolog) and the activity of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway in normal and leukemic T cells. Notch signaling and the PI3K-AKT pathway synergize in vivo in a Drosophila melanogaster model of Notch-induced tumorigenesis, and mutational loss of PTEN is associated with human T-ALL resistance to pharmacological inhibition of NOTCH1.

However, little is known about the transcriptional programs activated by NOTCH1. Using an integrative systems biology approach we show that NOTCH1 controls a feed-forward-loop transcriptional network that promotes cell growth. Inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling in T-ALL cells led to a reduction in cell size and elicited a gene expression signature dominated by down-regulated biosynthetic pathway genes. By integrating gene expression array and ChIP-on-chip data, we show that NOTCH1 directly activates multiple biosynthetic routes and induces c-MYC gene expression. Reverse engineering of regulatory networks from expression profiles showed that NOTCH1 and c-MYC govern two directly interconnected transcriptional programs containing common target genes that together regulate the growth of primary T-ALL cells. These results identify c-MYC as an essential mediator of NOTCH1 signaling and integrate NOTCH1 activation with oncogenic signaling pathways upstream of c-MYC.",

Here, we report the analysis for activating NOTCH1 mutations in a large number of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) primary samples and cell lines. We found activating mutations in NOTCH1 in a single M0 primary AML sample, in three (ML1, ML2 and CTV-1) out of 23 AML cell lines and in the diagnostic (myeloid) and relapsed (T-lymphoid) clones in a patient with lineage switch leukemia. Importantly, the ML1 and ML2 AML cell lines are derived from an AML relapse in a patient initially diagnosed with T-ALL. Overall, these results demonstrate that activating mutations in NOTCH1 are mostly restricted to T-ALL and are rare in AMLs. The presence of NOTCH1 mutations in myeloid and T-lymphoid clones in lineage switch leukemias establishes the common clonal origin of the diagnostic and relapse blast populations and suggests a stem cell origin of NOTCH1 mutations during the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors.",

      "abstract": "Aberrant expression of 1 or more transcription factor oncogenes is a critical component of the molecular pathogenesis of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL); however, oncogenic transcriptional programs downstream of T-ALL oncogenes are mostly unknown. TAL1/SCL is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor oncogene aberrantly expressed in 60% of human T-ALLs. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on chip to identify 71 direct transcriptional targets of TAL1/SCL. Promoters occupied by TAL1 were also frequently bound by the class I bHLH proteins E2A and HEB, suggesting that TAL1/E2A as well as TAL1/HEB heterodimers play a role in transformation of T-cell precursors. Using RNA interference, we demonstrated that TAL1 is required for the maintenance of the leukemic phenotype in Jurkat cells and showed that TAL1 binding can be associated with either repression or activation of genes whose promoters occupied by TAL1, E2A, and HEB. In addition, oligonucleotide microarray analysis of RNA from 47 primary T-ALL samples showed specific expression signatures involving TAL1 targets in TAL1-expressing compared with -nonexpressing human T-ALLs. Our results indicate that TAL1 may act as a bifunctional transcriptional regulator (activator and repressor) at the top of a complex regulatory network that disrupts normal T-cell homeostasis and contributes to leukemogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Activating mutations in NOTCH1 are present in over 50% of human T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) samples and inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling with gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI) has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this disease. Here, we report a new human T-cell lymphoma line CUTLL1, which expresses high levels of activated NOTCH1 and is extremely sensitive to gamma-secretase inhibitors treatment. CUTLL1 cells harbor a t(7;9)(q34;q34) translocation which induces the expression of a TCRB-NOTCH1 fusion transcript encoding a membrane-bound truncated form of the NOTCH1 receptor. GSI treatment of CUTLL1 cells blocked NOTCH1 processing and caused rapid clearance of activated intracellular NOTCH1. Loss of NOTCH1 activity induced a gene expression signature characterized by the downregulation of NOTCH1 target genes such as HES1 and NOTCH3. In contrast with most human T-ALL cell lines with activating mutations in NOTCH1, CUTLL1 cells showed a robust cellular phenotype upon GSI treatment characterized by G1 cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. These results show that the CUTLL1 cell line has a strong dependence on NOTCH1 signaling for proliferation and survival and supports that T-ALL patients whose tumors harbor t(7;9) should be included in clinical trials testing the therapeutic efficacy NOTCH1 inhibition with GSIs.",
