      "title": "Anti-tumor effects of an ID antagonist with no observed acquired resistance",
      "abstract": "ID proteins are helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcriptional regulators frequently overexpressed in cancer. ID proteins inhibit basic-HLH transcription factors often blocking differentiation and sustaining proliferation. A small-molecule, AGX51, targets ID proteins for degradation and impairs ocular neovascularization in mouse models. Here we show that AGX51 treatment of cancer cell lines impairs cell growth and viability that results from an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production upon ID degradation. In mouse models, AGX51 treatment suppresses breast cancer colonization in the lung, regresses the growth of paclitaxel-resistant breast tumors when combined with paclitaxel and reduces tumor burden in sporadic colorectal neoplasia. Furthermore, in cells and mice, we fail to observe acquired resistance to AGX51 likely the result of the inability to mutate the binding pocket without loss of ID function and efficient degradation of the ID proteins. Thus, AGX51 is a first-in-class compound that antagonizes ID proteins, shows strong anti-tumor effects and may be further developed for the management of multiple cancers.",

      "title": "Structural Model for Recruitment of RIT1 to the LZTR1 E3 Ligase: Evidences from an Integrated Computational Approach",
      "abstract": "Leucine-zipper transcription regulator 1 (LZTR1) is a highly mutated tumor suppressor gene, involved in the pathogenesis of several cancer types and developmental disorders. In proteasomal degradation, it acts as an adaptor protein responsible for the recognition and recruitment of substrates to be ubiquitinated in Cullin3-RING ligase E3 (CRL3) machinery. LZTR1 belongs to the BTB-Kelch family, a multi-domain protein where the Kelch propeller plays as the substrate recognition region and for which no experimental structure has been solved. Recently, large effort mutational analyses pointed to the role of disease-associated LZTR1 mutations in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway and RIT1, a small Ras-related GTPase protein, has been identified by mass spectroscopy to interact with LZTR1. Hence, a better understanding of native structure, molecular mechanism, and substrate specificity would help clarifying the role of LZTR1 in pathological diseases, thus promoting advancement in the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we address the interaction model between adaptor LZTR1 and substrate RIT1 by applying an integrated computational approach, including molecular modeling and docking techniques. We observe that the interaction model LZTR1-RIT1 is stabilized by an electrostatic bond network established between the two protein surfaces, which is reminiscent of homologous ubiquitin ligases complexes. Then, running MD simulations, we characterize differential conformational dynamics of the multi-domain LZTR1, offering interesting implications on the mechanistic role of specific point mutations. We identify G248R and R283Q as damaging mutations involved in the recognition process of the substrate RIT1 and R412C as a possible allosteric mutation from the Kelch to the C-term BTB-domain. Our findings provide important structural insights on targeting CRL3s for drug discovery.",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive nervous system cancer. Understanding its molecular pathogenesis is crucial to improving diagnosis and treatment. Integrated analysis of genomic, proteomic, post-translational modification and metabolomic data on 99 treatment-naive GBMs provides insights to GBM biology. We identify key phosphorylation events (e.g., phosphorylated PTPN11 and PLCG1) as potential switches mediating oncogenic pathway activation, as well as potential targets for EGFR-, TP53-, and RB1-altered tumors. Immune subtypes with distinct immune cell types are discovered using bulk omics methodologies, validated by snRNA-seq, and correlated with specific expression and histone acetylation patterns. Histone H2B acetylation in classical-like and immune-low GBM is driven largely by BRDs, CREBBP, and EP300. Integrated metabolomic and proteomic data identify specific lipid distributions across subtypes and distinct global metabolic changes in IDH-mutated tumors. This work highlights biological relationships that could contribute to stratification of GBM patients for more effective treatment.",

      "abstract": "As the clinical failure of glioblastoma treatment is attributed by multiple components, including myelin-associated infiltration, assessment of the molecular mechanisms underlying such process and identification of the infiltrating cells have been the primary objectives in glioblastoma research. Here, we adopted radiogenomic analysis to screen for functionally relevant genes that orchestrate the process of glioma cell infiltration through myelin and promote glioblastoma aggressiveness. The receptor of the Nogo ligand (NgR1) was selected as the top candidate through Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Gain and loss of function studies on NgR1 elucidated its underlying molecular importance in suppressing myelin-associated infiltration in vitro and in vivo. The migratory ability of glioblastoma cells on myelin is reversibly modulated by NgR1 during differentiation and dedifferentiation process through deubiquitinating activity of USP1, which inhibits the degradation of ID1 to downregulate NgR1 expression. Furthermore, pimozide, a well-known antipsychotic drug, upregulates NgR1 by post-translational targeting of USP1, which sensitizes glioma stem cells to myelin inhibition and suppresses myelin-associated infiltration in vivo. In primary human glioblastoma, downregulation of NgR1 expression is associated with highly infiltrative characteristics and poor survival. Together, our findings reveal that loss of NgR1 drives myelin-associated infiltration of glioblastoma and suggest that novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reactivating expression of NgR1 will improve the clinical outcome of glioblastoma patients.",

It relied exclusively on oxidative phosphorylation for energy production, whereas the glycolytic/plurimetabolic subtype was sustained by aerobic glycolysis and amino acid and lipid metabolism. Deletion of the glucose-proton symporter SLC45A1 was the truncal alteration most significantly associated with mitochondrial GBM, and the reintroduction of SLC45A1 in mitochondrial glioma cells induced acidification and loss of fitness. Mitochondrial, but not glycolytic/plurimetabolic, GBM exhibited marked vulnerability to inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation. The pathway-based classification of GBM informs survival and enables precision targeting of cancer metabolism.",

      "abstract": "We report a comprehensive proteogenomics analysis, including whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and proteomics and phosphoproteomics profiling, of 218 tumors across 7 histological types of childhood brain cancer: low-grade glioma (n\u00a0= 93), ependymoma (32), high-grade glioma (25), medulloblastoma (22), ganglioglioma (18), craniopharyngioma (16), and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (12). Proteomics data identify common biological themes that span histological boundaries, suggesting that treatments used for one histological type may be applied effectively to other tumors sharing similar proteomics features. Immune landscape characterization reveals diverse tumor microenvironments across and within diagnoses. Proteomics data further reveal functional effects of somatic mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) not evident in transcriptomics data. Kinase-substrate association and co-expression network analysis identify important biological mechanisms of tumorigenesis. This is the first large-scale proteogenomics analysis across traditional histological boundaries to uncover foundational pediatric brain tumor biology and inform rational treatment selection.",

Tumor cells with stem-like properties preferentially survive radiation and give rise to glioma recurrence. Various techniques for enriching and quantifying cells with stem-like properties have been used, including the fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-based side population (SP) assay, which is a functional assay that enriches for stem-like tumor cells. In these analyses, mouse models of glioma have been used to understand the biology of this disease and therapeutic responses, including the radiation response. We present combined SP analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing of genetically-engineered mouse models of glioma to show a time course of cellular response to radiation. We identify and characterize two distinct tumor cell populations that are inherently radioresistant and also distinct effects of radiation on immune cell populations within the tumor microenvironment.",

We introduce improved optically decodable mRNA capture beads and implement a more scalable and simplified optical decoding process. We demonstrate the utility of SCOPE-seq2 for fluorescence, morphological, and expression profiling of individual primary cells from a human glioblastoma (GBM) surgical sample, revealing relationships between simple imaging features and cellular identity, particularly among malignantly transformed tumor cells.",

      "abstract": "Activation of dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinases 1A and 1B (DYRK1A and DYRK1B) requires prolyl hydroxylation by PHD1 prolyl hydroxylase. Prolyl hydroxylation of DYRK1 initiates a cascade of events leading to the release of molecular constraints on von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin ligase tumor suppressor function. However, the proline residue of DYRK1 targeted by hydroxylation and the role of prolyl hydroxylation in tyrosine autophosphorylation of DYRK1 are unknown. We found that a highly conserved proline in the CMGC insert of the DYRK1 kinase domain is hydroxylated by PHD1, and this event precedes tyrosine autophosphorylation. Mutation of the hydroxylation acceptor proline precludes tyrosine autophosphorylation and folding of DYRK1, resulting in a kinase unable to preserve VHL function and lacking glioma suppression activity. The consensus proline sequence is shared by most CMGC kinases, and prolyl hydroxylation is essential for catalytic activation. Thus, formation of prolyl-hydroxylated intermediates is a novel mechanism of kinase maturation and likely a general mechanism of regulation of CMGC kinases in eukaryotes.",

      "abstract": "The interplay between glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promotes progression of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between these two cell types remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that ARS2 (arsenite-resistance protein 2), a zinc finger protein that is essential for early mammalian development, plays critical roles in GSC maintenance and M2-like TAM polarization. ARS2 directly activates its novel transcriptional target MGLL, encoding monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), to regulate the self-renewal and tumorigenicity of GSCs through production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which stimulates \u03b2-catenin activation of GSC and M2-like TAM polarization. We identify M2-like signature downregulated by which MAGL-specific inhibitor, JZL184, increased survival rate significantly in the mouse xenograft model by blocking PGE2 production. Taken together, our results suggest that blocking the interplay between GSCs and TAMs by targeting ARS2/MAGL signaling offers a potentially novel therapeutic option for GBM patients.",

      "abstract": "The evolutionary processes that drive universal therapeutic resistance in adult patients with diffuse glioma remain unclear1,2. Here we analysed temporally separated DNA-sequencing data and matched clinical annotation from 222 adult patients with glioma. By analysing mutations and copy numbers across the three major subtypes of diffuse glioma, we found that driver genes detected at the initial stage of disease were retained at recurrence, whereas there was little evidence of recurrence-specific gene alterations. Treatment with alkylating agents resulted in a hypermutator phenotype at different rates across the glioma subtypes, and hypermutation was not associated with differences in overall survival. Acquired aneuploidy was frequently detected in recurrent gliomas and was characterized by IDH mutation but without co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p/19q, and further converged with acquired alterations in the cell cycle and poor outcomes. The clonal architecture of each tumour remained similar over time, but the presence of subclonal selection was associated with decreased survival. Finally, there were no differences in the levels of immunoediting between initial and recurrent gliomas. Collectively, our results suggest that the strongest selective pressures occur during early glioma development and that current therapies shape this evolution in a largely stochastic manner.",

Id proteins are primarily expressed during development to inhibit differentiation, but they become re-expressed in adult tissues in diseases of the vasculature and cancer. We show that the genetic loss of Id1/Id3 reduces ocular neovascularization in mouse models of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). An in silico screen identifies AGX51, a small-molecule Id antagonist. AGX51 inhibits the Id1-E47 interaction, leading to ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Ids, cell growth arrest, and reduced viability. AGX51 is well-tolerated in mice and phenocopies the genetic loss of Id expression in AMD and ROP models by inhibiting retinal neovascularization. Thus, AGX51 is a first-in-class compound that antagonizes an interaction formerly considered undruggable and that may have utility in the management of multiple diseases.",

      "abstract": "Hypermutagenesis refers to marked increase in the number of mutations due to continuous mutagenic process. Hypermutated tumors, have being found in several tumor types, are associated with inherited or acquired alterations in the DNA repair pathways. Hypermutation has been observed in a subset of adult glioma patients as a direct result of temozolomide(TMZ)-induced mutagenesis. In our study, we have identified a rare subset of treatment-na\u00efve adult gliomas with de novo hypermutator phenotype and explored the evolution of spontaneous and treatment-induced hypermutagenesis. We conducted Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES), Whole-Transcriptome Sequencing (WTS), and Single-Cell Sequencing (SCS) of TMZ-na\u00efve and post-TMZ-treated hypermutated tumors to identify distinct clinical or genomic manifestations that contribute to the development of hypermutation in untreated adult gliomas. TMZ-na\u00efve hypermutated tumors were marked by absence of IDH1 somatic mutation and MGMT promoter (pMGMT) methylation, two genomic traits that were significantly associated with the TMZ-induced hypermutagenic event in glioblastoma, and harbored inherited alterations in the mismatch repair (MMR) machinery. The immediate family members of the TMZ-naive hypermutated glioma patients were also previous diagnosed with cancer development history, suggesting that germline dysfunction of the MMR pathway could potentially pose hereditary risk to genetic predisposition of carcinogenesis in gliomas. Lastly, both TMZ-na\u00efve and post-TMZ-treated hypermutated tumors exhibited a significant accumulation of neoantigen loads, suggesting immunotherapeutic alternatives. Our results present new and unique understanding of hypermutagenic process in adult gliomas and an important step towards clinical implication of immunotherapy in glioma treatment.",

We present single-cell hierarchical Poisson factorization (scHPF), a Bayesian factorization method that adapts hierarchical Poisson factorization (Gopalan et\u00a0al, 2015, Proceedings of the 31st Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, 326) for de novo discovery of both continuous and discrete expression patterns from scRNA-seq. scHPF does not require prior normalization and captures statistical properties of single-cell data better than other methods in benchmark datasets. Applied to scRNA-seq of the core and margin of a high-grade glioma, scHPF uncovers marked differences in the abundance of glioma subpopulations across tumor regions and regionally associated expression biases within glioma subpopulations. scHFP revealed an expression signature that was spatially biased toward the glioma-infiltrated margins and associated with inferior survival in glioblastoma.",

      "title": "The molecular landscape of glioma in patients with Neurofibromatosis 1",
      "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common tumor predisposition syndrome in which glioma is one of the prevalent tumors. Gliomagenesis in NF1 results in a heterogeneous spectrum of low- to high-grade neoplasms occurring during the entire lifespan of patients. The pattern of genetic and epigenetic alterations of glioma that develops in NF1 patients and the similarities with sporadic glioma remain unknown. Here, we present the molecular landscape of low- and high-grade gliomas in patients affected by NF1 (NF1-glioma). We found that the predisposing germline mutation of the NF1 gene was frequently converted to homozygosity and the somatic mutational load of NF1-glioma was influenced by age and grade. High-grade tumors harbored genetic alterations of TP53 and CDKN2A, frequent mutations of ATRX associated with Alternative Lengthening of Telomere, and were enriched in genetic alterations of transcription/chromatin regulation and PI3 kinase pathways. Low-grade tumors exhibited fewer mutations that were over-represented in genes of the MAP kinase pathway. Approximately 50% of low-grade NF1-gliomas displayed an immune signature, T lymphocyte infiltrates, and increased neo-antigen load. DNA methylation assigned NF1-glioma to LGm6, a poorly defined Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 wild-type subgroup enriched with ATRX mutations. Thus, the profiling of NF1-glioma defined a distinct landscape that recapitulates a subset of sporadic tumors.",

A high burden of tumor-specific mutant peptides (neoantigens) correlates with better survival and response to immunotherapies in selected solid tumors but how neoantigens impact clinical outcome in GBM remains unclear. Here, we exploit the similarity between tumor neoantigens and infectious disease-derived immune epitopes and apply a neoantigen fitness model for identifying high-quality neoantigens in a human pan-glioma dataset. We find that the neoantigen quality fitness model stratifies GBM patients with more favorable clinical outcome and, together with CD8+ T lymphocytes tumor infiltration, identifies a GBM subgroup with the longest survival, which displays distinct genomic and transcriptomic features. Conversely, neither tumor neoantigen burden from a quantitative model nor the isolated enrichment of CD8+ T lymphocytes were able to predict survival of GBM patients. This approach may guide optimal stratification of GBM patients for maximum response to immunotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Outcomes of anticancer therapy vary dramatically among patients due to diverse genetic and molecular backgrounds, highlighting extensive intertumoral heterogeneity. The fundamental tenet of precision oncology defines molecular characterization of tumors to guide optimal patient-tailored therapy. Towards this goal, we have established a compilation of pharmacological landscapes of 462 patient-derived tumor cells (PDCs) across 14 cancer types, together with genomic and transcriptomic profiling in 385 of these tumors. Compared with the traditional long-term cultured cancer cell line models, PDCs recapitulate the molecular properties and biology of the diseases more precisely. Here, we provide insights into dynamic pharmacogenomic associations, including molecular determinants that elicit therapeutic resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and the potential repurposing of ibrutinib (currently used in hematological malignancies) for EGFR-specific therapy in gliomas. Lastly, we present a potential implementation of PDC-derived drug sensitivities for the prediction of clinical response to targeted therapeutics using retrospective clinical studies.",

They are resistant to conventional treatment by concomitant radiochemotherapy and carry a dismal prognosis. The discovery of oncogenic gene fusions in these tumors has led to prospective targeted treatments, but identification of these rare alterations in practice is challenging. Here, we report a series of 30 adult diffuse gliomas with an in frame FGFR3-TACC3 oncogenic fusion (n\u2009=\u200927 WHO grade IV and n\u2009=\u20093 WHO grade II) as well as their histological and molecular features. We observed recurrent morphological features (monomorphous ovoid nuclei, nuclear palisading and thin parallel cytoplasmic processes, endocrinoid network of thin capillaries) associated with frequent microcalcifications and desmoplasia. We report a constant immunoreactivity for FGFR3, which is a valuable method for screening for the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion with 100% sensitivity and 92% specificity. We confirmed the associated molecular features (typical genetic alterations of glioblastoma, except the absence of EGFR amplification, and an increased frequency of CDK4 and MDM2 amplifications). FGFR3 immunopositivity is a valuable tool to identify gliomas that are likely to harbor the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion for inclusion in targeted therapeutic trials.",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) accounts for up to 50% of brain parenchymal tumors. It is the most malignant type of brain cancer with very poor survival and limited remedies. Cancer subtyping is important for cancer research and therapy. Here, we report a new subtyping method for GBM based on the genetic alterations of CDKN2A and TP53 genes. CDKN2A and TP53 are the most frequently mutated genes with mutation rates of 60 and 30%, respectively. We found that patients with deletion of CDKN2A possess worse survival than those with TP53 mutation. Interestingly, survival of patients with both TP53 mutation and CDKN2A deletion is no worse than for those with only one of these genetic alterations, but similar to those with TP53 mutation alone. Next, we investigated differences in the gene expression profile between TP53 and CDKN2A samples. Consistent with the survival data, the samples with both TP53 mutation and CDKN2A deletion showed a gene expression profile similar to those samples with TP53 mutation alone. Finally, we found that activation of RAS pathway plus Cdkn2a/b silencing can induce GBM, in a similar way to tumor induction by RAS activation plus TP53 silencing. In conclusion, we show that the genetic alterations of CDKN2A and TP53 may be used to stratify GBM, and the new animal models matching this stratification method were generated.",

Here, we report that oligodendrocytic ablation of inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2) or Notch receptor 1 (Notch1), 2 negative master modulators of oligodendrocyte differentiation, fails to alleviate oligodendrocyte dysfunction or alter disease outcome in a murine model of ALS. Our data suggest that these inhibitors are not suitable targets for intervention in ALS.",

      "abstract": "Chordoid glioma (ChG) is a characteristic, slow growing, and well-circumscribed diencephalic tumor, whose mutational landscape is unknown. Here we report the analysis of 16 ChG by whole-exome and RNA-sequencing. We found that 15 ChG harbor the same PRKCA D463H mutation. PRKCA encodes the Protein kinase C (PKC) isozyme alpha (PKC\u03b1) and is mutated in a wide range of human cancers. However the hot spot PRKCA D463H mutation was not described in other tumors. PRKCA D463H is strongly associated with the activation of protein translation initiation (EIF2) pathway. PKC\u03b1D463H mRNA levels are more abundant than wild-type PKC\u03b1 transcripts, while PKC\u03b1D463H is less stable than the PCK\u03b1WT protein. Compared to PCK\u03b1WT, the PKC\u03b1D463H protein is depleted from the cell membrane. The PKC\u03b1D463H mutant enhances proliferation of astrocytes and tanycytes, the cells of origin of ChG. In conclusion, our study identifies the hallmark mutation for chordoid gliomas and provides mechanistic insights on ChG oncogenesis.",

      "abstract": "High-risk neuroblastomas show a paucity of recurrent somatic mutations at diagnosis. As a result, the molecular basis for this aggressive phenotype remains elusive. Recent progress in regulatory network analysis helped us elucidate disease-driving mechanisms downstream of genomic alterations, including recurrent chromosomal alterations. Our analysis identified three molecular subtypes of high-risk neuroblastomas, consistent with chromosomal alterations, and identified subtype-specific master regulator proteins that were conserved across independent cohorts. A 10-protein transcriptional module-centered around a TEAD4-MYCN positive feedback loop-emerged as the regulatory driver of the high-risk subtype associated with MYCN amplification. Silencing of either gene collapsed MYCN-amplified (MYCNAmp) neuroblastoma transcriptional hallmarks and abrogated viability in vitro and in vivo Consistently, TEAD4 emerged as a robust prognostic marker of poor survival, with activity independent of the canonical Hippo pathway transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ. These results suggest novel therapeutic strategies for the large subset of MYCN-deregulated neuroblastomas.Significance: Despite progress in understanding of neuroblastoma genetics, little progress has been made toward personalized treatment. Here, we present a framework to determine the downstream effectors of the genetic alterations sustaining neuroblastoma subtypes, which can be easily extended to other tumor types. We show the critical effect of disrupting a 10-protein module centered around a YAP/TAZ-independent TEAD4-MYCN positive feedback loop in MYCNAmp neuroblastomas, nominating TEAD4 as a novel candidate for therapeutic intervention.

      "abstract": "We propose a generic framework for gene regulatory network (GRN) inference approached as a feature selection problem. GRNs obtained using Machine Learning techniques are often dense, whereas real GRNs are rather sparse. We use a Tikonov regularization inspired optimal L-curve criterion that utilizes the edge weight distribution for a given target gene to determine the optimal set of TFs associated with it. Our proposed framework allows to incorporate a mechanistic active biding network based on cis-regulatory motif analysis. We evaluate our regularization framework in conjunction with two non-linear ML techniques, namely gradient boosting machines (GBM) and random-forests (GENIE), resulting in a regularized feature selection based method specifically called RGBM and RGENIE respectively. RGBM has been used to identify the main transcription factors that are causally involved as master regulators of the gene expression signature activated in the FGFR3-TACC3-positive glioblastoma. Here, we illustrate that RGBM identifies the main regulators of the molecular subtypes of brain tumors. Our analysis reveals the identity and corresponding biological activities of the master regulators characterizing the difference between G-CIMP-high and G-CIMP-low subtypes and between PA-like and LGm6-GBM, thus providing a clue to the yet undetermined nature of the transcriptional events among these subtypes.",

We charted the detailed landscape of pathway alterations in 33 cancer types, stratified into 64 subtypes, and identified patterns of co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity. Eighty-nine percent of tumors had at least one driver alteration in these pathways, and 57% percent of tumors had at least one alteration potentially targetable by currently available drugs. Thirty percent of tumors had multiple targetable alterations, indicating opportunities for combination therapy.",

      "abstract": "Chromosomal translocations that generate in-frame oncogenic gene fusions are notable examples of the success of targeted cancer therapies. We have previously described gene fusions of FGFR3-TACC3 (F3-T3) in 3% of human glioblastoma cases. Subsequent studies have reported similar frequencies of F3-T3 in many other cancers, indicating that F3-T3 is a commonly occuring fusion across all tumour types. F3-T3 fusions are potent oncogenes that confer sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors, but the downstream oncogenic signalling pathways remain unknown. Here we show that human tumours with F3-T3 fusions cluster within transcriptional subgroups that are characterized by the activation of mitochondrial functions. F3-T3 activates oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis and induces sensitivity to inhibitors of oxidative metabolism. Phosphorylation of the phosphopeptide PIN4 is an intermediate step in the signalling pathway of the activation of mitochondrial metabolism. The F3-T3-PIN4 axis triggers the biogenesis of peroxisomes and the synthesis of new proteins. The anabolic response converges on the PGC1\u03b1 coactivator through the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species, which enables mitochondrial respiration and tumour growth. These data illustrate the oncogenic circuit engaged by F3-T3 and show that F3-T3-positive tumours rely on mitochondrial respiration, highlighting this pathway as a therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of tumours with F3-T3 fusions. We also provide insights into the genetic alterations that initiate the chain of metabolic responses that drive mitochondrial metabolism in cancer.",

      "abstract": "Spermatogenesis is sustained by a heterogeneous population of spermatogonia that includes the spermatogonial stem cells. However, the mechanisms underlying their establishment from gonocyte embryonic precursors and their maintenance thereafter remain largely unknown. In this study, we report that inactivation of the ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 in male germ cells in mice led to the degeneration of spermatogonia in neonates and resulted in a Sertoli cell-only phenotype in the adult. Huwe1 knockout gonocytes showed a decrease in mitotic re-entry, which inhibited their transition to spermatogonia. Inactivation of Huwe1 in primary spermatogonial culture or the C18-4 cell line resulted in cell degeneration. Degeneration of Huwe1 knockout spermatogonia was associated with an increased level of histone H2AX and an elevated DNA damage response that led to apparent mitotic catastrophe but not apoptosis or senescence. Blocking this increase in H2AX prevented the degeneration of Huwe1-depleted cells. Taken together, these results reveal a previously undefined role of Huwe1 in orchestrating the physiological DNA damage response in the male germline that contributes to the establishment and maintenance of spermatogonia.",

      "abstract": "Ubiquitination-directed protein degradation is important in many cancers for tumor initiation and maintenance, and E3 ligases containing HECT domains are emerging as new therapeutic targets. In contrast to many other E3 ligases, the role of HUWE1 in ovarian cancer where HUWE1 is dysregulated has been unclear. Here we report that genetic deletion of Huwe1 in the mouse inhibits transformation of ovary surface epithelium cells without significantly affecting cell survival and apoptosis, and that Huwe1 deletion after tumors have been initiated inhibits tumor growth. In Huwe1-deficient cells, expression of histone H1.3 increased, inhibiting the expression of noncoding RNA H19H19 silencing phenocopied the effects of Huwe1 deficiency, whereas H1.3 silencing partially rescued the expression of H19 and the Huwe1-null phenotype. Inducible silencing of HUWE1 in human ovarian cancer cells produced a similar phenotype. Mechanistically, HUWE1 bound and ubiquitinated H1.3, which was consequently marked for destruction by proteasomes. Our results establish that HUWE1 plays an essential role in promoting ovarian cancer. Cancer Res; 77(18); 4773-84. \u00a92017 AACR.",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) comprises distinct subtypes characterized by their molecular profile. Mesenchymal identity in GBM has been associated with a comparatively unfavorable prognosis, primarily due to inherent resistance of these tumors to current therapies. The identification of molecular determinants of mesenchymal transformation could potentially allow for the discovery of new therapeutic targets. Zinc Finger and BTB Domain Containing 18 (ZBTB18/ZNF238/RP58) is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor with a crucial role in brain development and neuronal differentiation. Here, ZBTB18 is primarily silenced in the mesenchymal subtype of GBM through aberrant promoter methylation. Loss of ZBTB18 contributes to the aggressive phenotype of glioblastoma through regulation of poor prognosis-associated signatures. Restitution of ZBTB18 expression reverses the phenotype and impairs tumor-forming ability. These results indicate that ZBTB18 functions as a tumor suppressor in GBM through the regulation of genes associated with phenotypically aggressive properties.Implications: This study characterizes the role of the putative tumor suppressor ZBTB18 and its regulation by promoter hypermethylation, which appears to be a common mechanism to silence ZBTB18 in the mesenchymal subtype of GBM and provides a new mechanistic opportunity to specifically target this tumor subclass.

Here, we review this rapidly expanding field of research and discuss the unique biological and clinical features conferred to isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type glioma cells by FGFR-TACC fusions. FGFR-TACC fusions generate powerful oncogenes that combine growth-promoting effects with aneuploidy through the activation of as yet unclear intracellular signaling mechanisms. FGFR-TACC fusions appear to be clonal tumor-initiating events that confer strong sensitivity to FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Screening assays have recently been reported for the accurate identification of FGFR-TACC fusion variants in human cancer, and early clinical data have shown promising effects in cancer patients harboring FGFR-TACC fusions and treated with FGFR inhibitors. Thus, FGFR-TACC gene fusions provide a \"low-hanging fruit\" model for the validation of precision medicine paradigms in human GBM.",

However, this proposition is complicated by spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Here we study genomic and expression profiles across 127 multisector or longitudinal specimens from 52 individuals with glioblastoma (GBM). Using bulk and single-cell data, we find that samples from the same tumor mass share genomic and expression signatures, whereas geographically separated, multifocal tumors and/or long-term recurrent tumors are seeded from different clones. Chemical screening of patient-derived glioma cells (PDCs) shows that therapeutic response is associated with genetic similarity, and multifocal tumors that are enriched with PIK3CA mutations have a heterogeneous drug-response pattern. We show that targeting truncal events is more efficacious than targeting private events in reducing the tumor burden. In summary, this work demonstrates that evolutionary inference from integrated genomic analysis in multisector biopsies can inform targeted therapeutic interventions for patients with GBM.",

To generate animal models that reproduce the human tumors more faithfully than rodents, we present the first report of a cancer model mimicking human tumor genetics in tree shrew. By engineering a lentiviral system for the transduction of mutant H-Ras and a shRNA against tree shrew p53, we successfully generated malignant glioma in tree shrew. The tree shrew glioma exhibited aggressive behavior and a relatively short latency, and markedly reduced animal survival. Remarkably, the biological features of human high-grade glioma (necrosis, microvascular proliferation, pseudopalisading) were all present in tree shrew glioma. Furthermore, genetic analysis of tree shrew glioma revealed that the tumors were clustered within the mesenchymal subgroup of human glioblastoma multiforme. Compared with the corresponding mouse glioma, tree shrew gliomas were markedly more similar to human glioblastoma at gene expression profile. The tree shrew glioma model provides colleagues working in the field of gliomas and cancer in general with a more accurate animal model.",

      "abstract": "Cancer genome sequencing projects have identified hundreds of genetic alterations, often at low frequencies, raising questions as to their functional relevance. One exemplar gene is HUWE1, which has been found to be mutated in numerous studies. However, due to the large size of this gene and a lack of functional analysis of identified mutations, their significance to carcinogenesis is unclear. To determine the importance of HUWE1, we chose to examine its function in colorectal cancer, where it is mutated in up to 15 per cent of tumours. Modelling of identified mutations showed that they inactivate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of HUWE1. Genetic deletion of Huwe1 rapidly accelerated tumourigenic in mice carrying loss of the intestinal tumour suppressor gene Apc, with a dramatic increase in tumour initiation. Mechanistically, this phenotype was driven by increased MYC and rapid DNA damage accumulation leading to loss of the second copy of Apc The increased levels of DNA damage sensitised Huwe1-deficient tumours to DNA-damaging agents and to deletion of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1. Taken together, these data identify HUWE1 as a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in the intestinal epithelium and suggest a potential vulnerability of HUWE1-mutated tumours to DNA-damaging agents and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins.",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. To better understand how GBM evolves, we analyzed longitudinal genomic and transcriptomic data from 114 patients. The analysis shows a highly branched evolutionary pattern in which 63% of patients experience expression-based subtype changes. The branching pattern, together with estimates of evolutionary rate, suggests that relapse-associated clones typically existed years before diagnosis. Fifteen percent of tumors present hypermutation at relapse in highly expressed genes, with a clear mutational signature. We find that 11% of recurrence tumors harbor mutations in LTBP4, which encodes a protein binding to TGF-\u03b2. Silencing LTBP4 in GBM cells leads to suppression of TGF-\u03b2 activity and decreased cell proliferation. In recurrent GBM with wild-type IDH1, high LTBP4 expression is associated with worse prognosis, highlighting the TGF-\u03b2 pathway as a potential therapeutic target in GBM.",

We defined the complete set of genes associated with 1,122 diffuse grade II-III-IV gliomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas and used molecular profiles to improve disease classification, identify molecular correlations, and provide insights into the progression from low- to high-grade disease. Whole-genome sequencing data analysis determined that ATRX but not TERT promoter mutations are associated with increased telomere length. Recent advances in glioma classification based on IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion status were recapitulated through analysis of DNA methylation profiles, which identified clinically relevant molecular subsets. A subtype of IDH mutant glioma was associated with DNA demethylation and poor outcome; a group of IDH-wild-type diffuse glioma showed molecular similarity to pilocytic astrocytoma and relatively favorable survival. Understanding of cohesive disease groups may aid improved clinical outcomes. ",

      "title": "An ID2-dependent mechanism for VHL inactivation in cancer",
      "abstract": "Mechanisms that maintain cancer stem cells are crucial to tumour progression. The ID2 protein supports cancer hallmarks including the cancer stem cell state. HIF\u03b1 transcription factors, most notably HIF2\u03b1 (also known as EPAS1), are expressed in and required for maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, the pathways that are engaged by ID2 or drive HIF2\u03b1 accumulation in CSCs have remained unclear. Here we report that DYRK1A and DYRK1B kinases phosphorylate ID2 on threonine 27 (Thr27). Hypoxia downregulates this phosphorylation via inactivation of DYRK1A and DYRK1B. The activity of these kinases is stimulated in normoxia by the oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylase PHD1 (also known as EGLN2). ID2 binds to the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex, displaces VHL-associated Cullin 2, and impairs HIF2\u03b1 ubiquitylation and degradation. Phosphorylation of Thr27 of ID2 by DYRK1 blocks ID2-VHL interaction and preserves HIF2\u03b1 ubiquitylation. In glioblastoma, ID2 positively modulates HIF2\u03b1 activity. Conversely, elevated expression of DYRK1 phosphorylates Thr27 of ID2, leading to HIF2\u03b1 destabilization, loss of glioma stemness, inhibition of tumour growth, and a more favourable outcome for patients with glioblastoma.

      "abstract": "Tumors are the result of accumulated genomic alterations that cooperate synergistically to produce uncontrollable cell growth. Although identifying recurrent alterations among large collections of tumors provides a way to pinpoint genes that endow a selective advantage in oncogenesis and progression, it fails to address the genetic interactions behind this selection process. A non-random pattern of co-mutated genes is evidence for selective forces acting on tumor cells that harbor combinations of these genetic alterations. Although existing methods have successfully identified mutually exclusive gene sets, no current method can systematically discover more general genetic relationships. We develop Genomic Alteration Modules using Total Correlation (GAMToC), an information theoretic framework that integrates copy number and mutation data to identify gene modules with any non-random pattern of joint alteration. Additionally, we present the Seed-GAMToC procedure, which uncovers the mutational context of any putative cancer gene. The software is publicly available. Applied to glioblastoma multiforme samples, GAMToC results show distinct subsets of co-occurring mutations, suggesting distinct mutational routes to cancer and providing new insight into mutations associated with proneural, proneural/G-CIMP, and classical types of the disease. The results recapitulate known relationships such as mutual exclusive mutations, place these alterations in the context of other mutations, and find more complex relationships such as conditional mutual exclusivity.

      "abstract": "Recently, we demonstrated that the microRNA 424(322)/503 [miR-424(322)/503] cluster is transcriptionally controlled by transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) in the mammary epithelium. Induction of this microRNA cluster impacts mammary epithelium fate by regulating apoptosis and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling. Here, we expanded our finding to demonstrate that miR-424(322)/503 is an integral component of the cell cycle arrest mediated by TGF-\u03b2. Mechanistically, we showed that after TGF-\u03b2 exposure, increased levels of miR-424(322)/503 reduce the expression of the cell cycle regulator CDC25A. miR-424(322)/503-dependent posttranscriptional downregulation of CDC25A cooperates with previously described transcriptional repression of the CDC25A promoter and proteasome-mediated degradation to reduce the levels of CDC25A expression and to induce cell cycle arrest. We also provide evidence that the TGF-\u03b2/miR-424(322)/503 axis is part of the mechanism that regulates the proliferation of hormone receptor-positive (HR(+)) mammary epithelial cells in vivo. ",

      "abstract": "The mammary gland is a very dynamic organ that undergoes continuous remodeling. The critical regulators of this process are not fully understood. Here we identify the microRNA cluster miR-424(322)/503 as an important regulator of epithelial involution after pregnancy. Through the generation of a knockout mouse model, we found that regression of the secretory acini of the mammary gland was compromised in the absence of miR-424(322)/503. Mechanistically, we show that miR-424(322)/503 orchestrates cell life and death decisions by targeting BCL-2 and IGF1R (insulin growth factor-1 receptor). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expression of this microRNA cluster is regulated by TGF-\u03b2, a well-characterized regulator of mammary involution. Overall, our data suggest a model in which activation of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway after weaning induces the transcription of miR-424(322)/503, which in turn down-regulates the expression of key genes. Here, we unveil a previously unknown, multilayered regulation of epithelial tissue remodeling coordinated by the microRNA cluster miR-424(322)/503. ",

Here we describe a computational platform that integrates the analysis of copy number variations and somatic mutations and unravels the landscape of in-frame gene fusions in glioblastoma. We found mutations with loss of heterozygosity in LZTR1, encoding an adaptor of CUL3-containing E3 ligase complexes. Mutations and deletions disrupt LZTR1 function, which restrains the self renewal and growth of glioma spheres that retain stem cell features. Loss-of-function mutations in CTNND2 target a neural-specific gene and are associated with the transformation of glioma cells along the very aggressive mesenchymal phenotype. We also report recurrent translocations that fuse the coding sequence of EGFR to several partners, with EGFR-SEPT14 being the most frequent functional gene fusion in human glioblastoma. EGFR-SEPT14 fusions activate STAT3 signaling and confer mitogen independence and sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. These results provide insights into the pathogenesis of glioblastoma and highlight new targets for therapeutic intervention. ",

Here, we report the development of an unbiased method for computational integration of copy number variation, expression, and mutation data from large datasets. Using this method, we identified rhophilin 2 (RHPN2) as a central genetic determinant of the mesenchymal phenotype of human GBM. Notably, amplification of the human RHPN2 gene on chromosome 19 correlates with a dramatic decrease in the survival of patients with glioma. Ectopic expression of RHPN2 in neural stem cells and astrocytes triggered the expression of mesenchymal genes and promoted an invasive phenotype without impacting cell proliferation. Mechanistically, these effects were implemented through RHPN2-mediated activation of RhoA, a master regulator of cell migration and invasion. Our results define RHPN2 amplification as a central genetic determinant of a highly aggressive phenotype that directs the worst clinical outcomes in patients with GBM.",

      "abstract": "High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are incurable brain tumors that are characterized by the presence of glioma-initiating cells (GICs). GICs are essential to tumor aggressiveness and retain the capacity for self-renewal and multilineage differentiation as long as they reside in the perivascular niche. ID proteins are master regulators of stemness and anchorage to the extracellular niche microenvironment, suggesting that they may play a role in maintaining GICs. Here, we modeled the probable therapeutic impact of ID inactivation in HGG by selective ablation of Id in tumor cells and after tumor initiation in a new mouse model of human mesenchymal HGG. Deletion of 3 Id genes induced rapid release of GICs from the perivascular niche, followed by tumor regression. GIC displacement was mediated by derepression of Rap1gap and subsequent inhibition of RAP1, a master regulator of cell adhesion. We identified a signature module of 5 genes in the ID pathway, including RAP1GAP, which segregated 2 subgroups of glioma patients with markedly different clinical outcomes. The model-informed survival analysis together with genetic and functional studies establish that ID activity is required for the maintenance of mesenchymal HGG and suggest that pharmacological inactivation of ID proteins could serve as a therapeutic strategy.",

      "abstract": "The brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is among the most lethal forms of human cancer. Here, we report that a small subset of GBMs (3.1%; 3 of 97 tumors examined) harbors oncogenic chromosomal translocations that fuse in-frame the tyrosine kinase coding domains of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes (FGFR1 or FGFR3) to the transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC) coding domains of TACC1 or TACC3, respectively. The FGFR-TACC fusion protein displays oncogenic activity when introduced into astrocytes or stereotactically transduced in the mouse brain. The fusion protein, which localizes to mitotic spindle poles, has constitutive kinase activity and induces mitotic and chromosomal segregation defects and triggers aneuploidy. Inhibition of FGFR kinase corrects the aneuploidy, and oral administration of an FGFR inhibitor prolongs survival of mice harboring intracranial FGFR3-TACC3-initiated glioma. FGFR-TACC fusions could potentially identify a subset of GBM patients who would benefit from targeted FGFR kinase inhibition.",

How the transcriptional machinery controls residency of stem cells in the niche is unknown. Here we show that Id proteins coordinate stem-cell activities with anchorage of neural stem cells (NSCs) to the niche. Conditional inactivation of three Id genes in NSCs triggered detachment of embryonic and postnatal NSCs from the ventricular and vascular niche, respectively. The interrogation of the gene modules directly targeted by Id deletion in NSCs revealed that Id proteins repress bHLH-mediated activation of Rap1GAP, thus serving to maintain the GTPase activity of RAP1, a key mediator of cell adhesion. Preventing the elevation of the Rap1GAP level countered the consequences of Id loss on NSC-niche interaction and stem-cell identity. Thus, by preserving anchorage of NSCs to the extracellular environment, Id activity synchronizes NSC functions to residency in the specialized niche.",

      "abstract": "We have generated a knockout mouse strain in which the gene coding for the ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 has been inactivated in cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNPs) and radial glia. These mice have a high rate of postnatal lethality and profound cerebellar abnormalities. The external granule layer of the cerebellum, which contains CGNPs, is expanded and displays aberrant proliferation and impaired differentiation of the progenitor cell population. The uncontrolled proliferation of the CGNPs is associated with accumulation of the N-Myc oncoprotein, a substrate of Huwe1, and con-sequent activation of the signaling events downstream to N-Myc. Furthermore, loss of Huwe1 in Bergmann glia leads to extensive disorganization of this cell population with layering aberrations, severe granule neuron migration defects, and persistence of ectopic clusters of granule neurons in the external granule layer. Our findings uncover an unexpected role for Huwe1 in regulating Berg-mann glia differentiation and indicate that this ubiquitin ligase orchestrates the programming of the neural progenitors that give rise to neurons and glia in the cerebellum.",

      "abstract": "The inference of transcriptional networks that regulate transitions into physiological or pathological cellular states remains a central challenge in systems biology. A mesenchymal phenotype is the hallmark of tumour aggressiveness in human malignant glioma, but the regulatory programs responsible for implementing the associated molecular signature are largely unknown. Here we show that reverse-engineering and an unbiased interrogation of a glioma-specific regulatory network reveal the transcriptional module that activates expression of mesenchymal genes in malignant glioma. Two transcription factors (C/EBPbeta and STAT3) emerge as synergistic initiators and master regulators of mesenchymal transformation. Ectopic co-expression of C/EBPbeta and STAT3 reprograms neural stem cells along the aberrant mesenchymal lineage, whereas elimination of the two factors in glioma cells leads to collapse of the mesenchymal signature and reduces tumour aggressiveness. In human glioma, expression of C/EBPbeta and STAT3 correlates with mesenchymal differentiation and predicts poor clinical outcome. These results show that the activation of a small regulatory module is necessary and sufficient to initiate and maintain an aberrant phenotypic state in cancer cells.",

      "abstract": "Self-renewal and proliferation of neural stem cells and the decision to initiate neurogenesis are crucial events directing brain development. Here we show that the ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 operates upstream of the N-Myc-DLL3-Notch pathway to control neural stem cell activity and promote neurogenesis. Conditional inactivation of the Huwe1 gene in the mouse brain caused neonatal lethality associated with disorganization of the laminar patterning of the cortex. These defects stemmed from severe impairment of neurogenesis associated with uncontrolled expansion of the neural stem cell compartment. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments in the mouse cortex demonstrated that Huwe1 restrains proliferation and enables neuronal differentiation by suppressing the N-Myc-DLL3 cascade. Notably, human high-grade gliomas carry focal hemizygous deletions of the X-linked Huwe1 gene in association with amplification of the N-myc locus. Our results indicate that Huwe1 balances proliferation and neurogenesis in the developing brain and that this pathway is subverted in malignant brain tumors.",

Ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the N-Myc oncoprotein in neural stem/progenitor cells is thought to trigger the arrest of proliferation and begin differentiation. Here we report that the HECT-domain ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 ubiquitinates the N-Myc oncoprotein through Lys 48-mediated linkages and targets it for destruction by the proteasome. This process is physiologically implemented by embryonic stem (ES) cells differentiating along the neuronal lineage and in the mouse brain during development. Genetic and RNA interference-mediated inactivation of the Huwe1 gene impedes N-Myc degradation, prevents exit from the cell cycle by opposing the expression of Cdk inhibitors and blocks differentiation through persistent inhibition of early and late markers of neuronal differentiation. Silencing of N-myc in cells lacking Huwe1 restores neural differentiation of ES cells and rescues cell-cycle exit and differentiation of the mouse cortex, demonstrating that Huwe1 restrains proliferation and enables neuronal differentiation by mediating the degradation of N-Myc. These findings indicate that Huwe1 links destruction of N-Myc to the quiescent state that complements differentiation in the neural tissue.",

By fueling several key features of tumor progression (deregulated proliferation, invasiveness, angiogenesis and metastasis), ID proteins contribute to multiple steps of tumorigenesis. Through oncogenic processes that lead to their aberrant activation in tumors, ID proteins transfer the phenotypic traits of embryonic stem cells to cancer cells. However, ID proteins have recently emerged as highly specialized factors in post-mitotic neurons. The elevated expression of ID proteins arrests neurons in the axon growth mode and prevents cessation of axonal elongation.

      "abstract": "In the developing nervous system, Id2 (inhibitor of DNA binding 2, also known as inhibitor of differentiation 2) enhances cell proliferation, promotes tumour progression and inhibits the activity of neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors. The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome and its activator Cdh1 (APC/C(Cdh1)) restrains axonal growth but the targets of APC/C(Cdh1) in neurons are unknown. Id2 and other members of the Id family are very unstable proteins that are eliminated as cells enter the quiescent state, but how they are targeted for degradation has remained elusive. Here we show that Id2 interacts with the core subunits of APC/C and Cdh1 in primary neurons. APC/C(Cdh1) targets Id2 for degradation through a destruction box motif (D box) that is conserved in Id1 and Id4. Depletion of Cdh1 stabilizes Id proteins in neurons, whereas Id2 D-box mutants are impaired for Cdh1 binding and remain stable in cells that exit from the cell cycle and contain active APC/C(Cdh1). Mutants of the Id2 D box enhance axonal growth in cerebellar granule neurons in vitro and in the context of the cerebellar cortex, and overcome the myelin inhibitory signals for growth. Conversely, activation of bHLH transcription factors induces a cluster of genes with potent axonal inhibitory functions including the gene coding for the Nogo receptor, a key transducer of myelin inhibition. Degradation of Id2 in neurons permits the accumulation of the Nogo receptor, thereby linking APC/C(Cdh1) activity with bHLH target genes for the inhibition of axonal growth. These findings indicate that deregulated Id activity might be useful to reprogramme quiescent neurons into the axonal growth mode.",

      "title": "E Proteins and Id2 converge on p57Kip2 to regulate cell cycle in neural cells",
      "abstract": "A precise balance between proliferation and differentiation must be maintained during neural development to obtain the correct proportion of differentiated cell types in the adult nervous system. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors known as E proteins and their natural inhibitors, the Id proteins, control the timing of differentiation and terminal exit from the cell cycle. Here we show that progression into S phase of human neuroblastoma cells is prevented by E proteins and promoted by Id2. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKI) have been identified as key effectors of cell cycle arrest in differentiating cells. However, p57Kip2 is the only CKI that is absolutely required for normal development. Through the use of global gene expression analysis in neuroblastoma cells engineered to acutely express the E protein E47 and Id2, we find that p57Kip2 is a target of E47. Consistent with the role of Id proteins, Id2 prevents activation of p57Kip2 expression, and the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, a known Id2 inhibitor, counters this activity. The strong E47-mediated inhibition of entry into S phase is entirely reversed in cells in which expression of p57Kip2 is silenced by RNA interference. During brain development, expression of p57Kip2 is opposite that of Id2. Our findings identify p57Kip2 as a functionally relevant target recruited by bHLH transcription factors to induce cell cycle arrest in developing neuroblasts and suggest that deregulated expression of Id proteins may be an epigenetic mechanism to silence expression of this CKI in neural tumors.",

      "title": "The protein ENH is a cytoplasmic sequestration factor for Id2 in normal and tumor cells from the nervous system",
      "abstract": "Id2 is a natural inhibitor of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein. Active Id2 prevents differentiation and promotes cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis in the nervous system. A key event that regulates Id2 activity during differentiation is translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Here we show that the actin-associated protein enigma homolog (ENH) is a cytoplasmic retention factor for Id2. ENH contains three LIM domains, which bind to the helix-loop-helix domain of Id proteins in vitro and in vivo. ENH is up-regulated during neural differentiation, and its ectopic expression in neuroblastoma cells leads to translocation of Id2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, with consequent inactivation of transcriptional and cell-cycle-promoting functions of Id2. Conversely, silencing of ENH by RNA interference prevents cytoplasmic relocation of Id2 in neuroblastoma cells differentiated with retinoic acid. Finally, the differentiated neural crest-derived tumor ganglioneuroblastoma coexpresses Id2 and ENH in the cytoplasm of ganglionic cells. These data indicate that ENH contributes to differentiation of the nervous system through cytoplasmic sequestration of Id2. They also suggest that ENH is a restraining factor of the oncogenic activity of Id proteins in neural tumors.",

      "title": "Id2 mediates tumor initiation, proliferation, and angiogenesis in Rb mutant mice",
      "abstract": "The inhibitor of differentiation Id2 is a target of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein during mouse embryogenesis. In Rb(+/-) mice, LOH at the wild-type Rb allele initiates pituitary adenocarcinoma, a tumor derived from embryonic melanotropes. Here we identify a critical role for Id2 in initiation, growth, and angiogenesis of pituitary tumors from Rb(+/-) mice. We show that proliferation and differentiation are intimately coupled in Rb(+/-) pituitary cells before tumor initiation. In Id2-null pituitaries, premature activation of basic helix-loop-helix-mediated transcription and expression of the cdk inhibitor p27(Kip1) impairs the proliferation of melanotropes and tumor initiation. Without Id2, Rb(+/-) mice have fewer early tumor lesions and a markedly decreased proliferation rate of the tumor foci. Expression of Id2 by pituitary tumor cells promotes growth and angiogenesis by functioning as a master regulator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In human neuroblastoma, the N-Myc-driven expression of Id2 is sufficient and necessary for expression of VEGF. These results establish that aberrant Id2 activity directs initiation and progression of embryonal cancer.",

      "title": "Retinoblastoma promotes definitive erythropoiesis by repressing Id2 in fetal liver macrophages",
      "abstract": "In mammals, the fetal liver is the first site of definitive erythropoiesis-the generation of mature, enucleated red cells. The functional unit for definitive erythropoiesis is the erythroblastic island, a multicellular structure composed of a central macrophage surrounded by erythroblasts at various stages of differentiation. Targeted disruption of the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor gene in the mouse leads to embryonic death caused by failure of erythroblasts to enucleate. The erythroid defect has been attributed to loss of Rb in cells that support erythropoiesis, but the identity of these cells is unknown. Here we show that Rb-deficient embryos carry profound abnormalities of fetal liver macrophages that prevent physical interactions with erythroblasts. In contrast, wild-type macrophages bind Rb-deficient erythroblasts and lead them to terminal differentiation and enucleation. Loss of Id2, a helix-loop-helix protein that mediates the lethality of Rb-deficient embryos, rescues the defects of Rb-deficient fetal liver macrophages. Rb promotes differentiation of macrophages by opposing the inhibitory functions of Id2 on the transcription factor PU.1, a master regulator of macrophage differentiation. Thus, Rb has a cell autonomous function in fetal liver macrophages, and restrains Id2 in these cells in order to implement definitive erythropoiesis.",

      "abstract": "Id proteins are general inhibitors of differentiation and positive regulators of proliferation in the nervous system. The role of Id is especially evident in neural development, a period during which Id proteins prevent premature differentiation and terminal cell cycle arrest. These activities have been related to the recognized ability of Id proteins to antagonize basic helix loop helix transcription factors and proteins of the Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor family. In recent experiments, it was shown that Id proteins-normally low or absent in post-natal tissues-are abnormally expressed by tumor and endothelial cells of neoplasms derived from the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. In these tumors, deregulated Id activity has been associated with relentless proliferation, loss of differentiation and neo-angiogenesis, all key features of neural tumor progression. Future work will be required to fully elucidate the molecular networks engaged by Id proteins to contribute to the essential hallmarks of neural cancer.",
