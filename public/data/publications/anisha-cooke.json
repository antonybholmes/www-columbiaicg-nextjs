      "abstract": "Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) and peripheral T cell lymphoma not-otherwise-specified (PTCL, NOS) have poor prognosis and lack driver actionable targets for directed therapies in most cases. Here we identify FYN-TRAF3IP2 as a recurrent oncogenic gene fusion in AITL and PTCL, NOS tumors. Mechanistically, we show that FYN-TRAF3IP2 leads to aberrant NF-\u03baB signaling downstream of T cell receptor activation. Consistent with a driver oncogenic role, FYN-TRAF3IP2 expression in hematopoietic progenitors induces NF-\u03baB-driven T cell transformation in mice and cooperates with loss of the Tet2 tumor suppressor in PTCL development. Moreover, abrogation of NF-\u03baB signaling in FYN-TRAF3IP2-induced tumors with I\u03baB kinase inhibitors delivers strong anti-lymphoma effects in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate an oncogenic and pharmacologically targetable role for FYN-TRAF3IP2 in PTCLs and call for the clinical testing of anti-NF-\u03baB targeted therapies in these diseases.",

      "title": "GATA3-Controlled Nucleosome Eviction Drives MYC Enhancer Activity in T-cell Development and Leukemia",
      "abstract": "Long-range enhancers govern the temporal and spatial control of gene expression; however, the mechanisms that regulate enhancer activity during normal and malignant development remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a role for aberrant chromatin accessibility in the regulation of MYC expression in T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Central to this process, the NOTCH1-MYC enhancer (N-Me), a long-range T cell-specific MYC enhancer, shows dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility during T-cell specification and maturation and an aberrant high degree of chromatin accessibility in mouse and human T-ALL cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that GATA3-driven nucleosome eviction dynamically modulates N-Me enhancer activity and is strictly required for NOTCH1-induced T-ALL initiation and maintenance. These results directly implicate aberrant regulation of chromatin accessibility at oncogenic enhancers as a mechanism of leukemic transformation. SIGNIFICANCE: MYC is a major effector of NOTCH1 oncogenic programs in T-ALL. Here, we show a major role for GATA3-mediated enhancer nucleosome eviction as a driver of MYC expression and leukemic transformation. These results support the role of aberrant chromatin accessibility and consequent oncogenic MYC enhancer activation in NOTCH1-induced T-ALL.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1631.",
