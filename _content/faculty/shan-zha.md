The Zha lab investigates how defects in DNA repair and DNA damage responses impact normal immune system development, lymphomagenesis, and treatment responses. The lab has developed cutting-edge technologies, including high-throughput translocation sequencing, sing cell-seq, multi-color flow-cytometry, CRISPR-based depletion and activation screens, high-content live-cell imaging, and a collection of over sixty-five unique mouse models, including the serial of mouse models expressing catalytically inactive ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs, and now PARP1 and PARP2, which revealed unexpected structural function of DNA damage response factors. More details can be found at <a class="text-cuimc-button-blue" href="https://www.zhalab.org" target="_blank">zhalab.org</a>. We invite committed young scientists to join us in the adventures.
