The amount of high throughput data in biological and clinical systems, from next-generation sequencing experiments to electronic health records, is increasing dramatically, allowing for the development of a quantitative understanding of these complex systems. Raul Rabadan has assembled an interdisciplinary team interested in developing mathematical and computational tools to extract useful biological information from large data sets.
