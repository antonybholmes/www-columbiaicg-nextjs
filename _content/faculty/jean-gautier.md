Jean Gautier studies the mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of genome stability. The laboratory employs diverse experimental approaches to elucidate the causes and the role of genome instability in cancer. Cell-free extracts derived from the egg of the frog Xenopus laevis are used as a simple model system to study processes that govern genome stability, including DNA replication control, DNA repair, and the cellular response to DNA damage. In addition, cultured normal and tumor cells and mouse models are exploited to analyze biological responses to DNA damage. The Gautier laboratory use a range of techniques including biochemistry, proteomics, live-cell imaging, super-resolution microscopy, Hi-C and genome-wide translocation sequencing.
