Cory Abate-Shen seeks to understand how normal mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and cellular differentiation are co-opted in cancer. Research in the Abate-Shen laboratory is focused on prostate and bladder cancer and encompasses mechanism-based studies, analyses of genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs), and state-of-the-art systems biology approaches. They have developed an extensive series of GEMMs that represent the full spectrum of prostate cancer phenotypes, ranging from pre-invasive to invasive cancer, including castration-resistance, neuroendocrine differentiation, and metastasis. Capitalizing on these GEMMs, they have generated genome-wide transcriptional regulatory networks to pursue cross-species computational analyses of mouse and human prostate cancer, which have led to the identification of master regulators of cancer progression, biomarkers of disease outcome, and regulators of drug response and resistance. The lab has also developed novel approaches to target gene recombination specifically to bladder urothelium, which led to the generation of a novel series of mouse models of muscle invasive bladder cancer. These have enabled co-clinical trials that are impacting the treatment of patients with high-risk bladder cancer.
