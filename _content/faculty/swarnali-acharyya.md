The Acharyya laboratory is focused on understanding mechanisms of cancer progression and metastasis as well as the systemic effects of metastasis.Over 90% of cancer-related deaths in solid tumors are due to metastasis, which is the process of dissemination and growth of cancer cells in vital organs. During cancer progression, tumors systemically reprogram host physiology, metabolism, and immune responses. These systemic effects are mediated by the release of soluble factors, exosomes, and metabolites by tumors into the circulation. In metastatic disease, these systemic effects even impact tissues where cancer cells rarely metastasize, such as skeletal muscle, and leads to a debilitating muscle-wasting syndrome, known as cachexia. Cachexia is associated with a reduced tolerance to anti-neoplastic therapy, which contributes to poor prognosis and accelerated death in cancer patients. The Acharyya laboratory seeks to understand the mechanisms that drive cachexia, and to develop strategies that can treat cachexia.
