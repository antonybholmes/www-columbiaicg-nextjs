Teresa Palomero studies the genetics and mechanisms of transformation in Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL), a heterogenous group of mature T-cell malignancies. Her group developed a cutting-edge research program implementing the integrative use of whole exome sequencing, gene expression profiling and single cell sequencing to identify novel drivers of transformation and tumor evolution in PTCL. They identified RHOA G17V and FYN mutations as major drivers of Angioinmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL); dissected the mutational landscape of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) and Sezary Syndrome; and identified new activating alterations in VAV1 in PTCL. Moreover, they pioneered the development of some of the first genetically engineered mouse models of AITL. Using those models in combination with in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of transformations in PTCL, the Palomero laboratory has the expertise to evaluate the impact of targeted therapies in T-cell lymphoma.
