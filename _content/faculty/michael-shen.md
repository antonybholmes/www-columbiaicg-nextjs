The Shen Laboratory investigates the molecular mechanisms of mammalian development and cancer using in vivo analyses of genetically engineered mouse models. Initially, the Shen group focused on functional analyses of the signaling pathway for the TGF-beta ligand Nodal, and elucidation of the multiple mechanisms of its regulation during mouse embryogenesis.
Presently, the lab research also encompasses analyses of prostate epithelial progenitor cells and their roles in organogenesis and tissue regeneration, focusing on the role of the _Nkx3.1_ transcriptional regulator as well as analysis of cell types of origin for prostate cancer. Ongoing projects include systems analyses of embryonic stem cell pluripotency, investigation of mechanisms of prostate epithelial lineage specification and cell-type differentiation, and generation of novel mouse models of advanced prostate cancer. Recent studies also include bladder cancer evolution and drug response through the analysis of patient-derived bladder tumor organoids.
