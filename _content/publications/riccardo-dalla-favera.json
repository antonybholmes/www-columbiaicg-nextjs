      "title": "Genetic mechanisms of HLA-I loss and immune escape in diffuse large B cell lymphoma",
      "abstract": "Fifty percent of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases lack cell-surface expression of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I), thus escaping recognition by cytotoxic T cells. Here we show that, across B cell lymphomas, loss of MHC-I, but not MHC-II, is preferentially restricted to DLBCL. To identify the involved mechanisms, we performed whole exome and targeted HLA deep-sequencing in 74 DLBCL samples, and found somatic inactivation of B2M and the HLA-I loci in 80% (34 of 42) of MHC-INEG tumors. Furthermore, 70% (22 of 32) of MHC-IPOS DLBCLs harbored monoallelic HLA-I genetic alterations (MHC-IPOS/mono), indicating allele-specific inactivation. MHC-INEG and MHC-IPOS/mono cases harbored significantly higher mutational burden and inferred neoantigen load, suggesting potential coselection of HLA-I loss and sustained neoantigen production. Notably, the analysis of >500,000 individuals across different cancer types revealed common germline HLA-I homozygosity, preferentially in DLBCL. In mice, germinal-center B cells lacking HLA-I expression did not progress to lymphoma and were counterselected in the context of oncogene-driven lymphomagenesis, suggesting that additional events are needed to license immune evasion. These results suggest a multistep process of HLA-I loss in DLBCL development including both germline and somatic events, and have direct implications for the pathogenesis and immunotherapeutic targeting of this disease.",

CLL is an incurable disease with a heterogeneous clinical course, for which the treatment decision still relies on conventional parameters (such as clinical stage and lymphocyte doubling time). During the past 5 years, relevant advances have been made in understanding CLL biology. Indeed, substantial progress has been made in the identification of the putative cell of origin of CLL, and comprehensive studies have dissected the genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic landscape of CLL. Advances in clinical management include improvements in our understanding of the prognostic value of different genetic lesions, particularly those associated with chemoresistance and progression to highly aggressive forms of CLL, and the advent of new therapies targeting crucial biological pathways. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the genetic lesions involved in the pathogenesis of CLL and how these genetic insights influence clinical management and the development of new therapeutic strategies for this disease.",

      "abstract": "Inactivating mutations of the CREBBP and EP300 acetyltransferases are among the most common genetic alterations in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). Here, we examined the relationship between these two enzymes in germinal center (GC) B cells, the normal counterpart of FL and DLBCL, and in lymphomagenesis by using conditional GC-directed deletion mouse models targeting Crebbp or Ep300. We found that CREBBP and EP300 modulate common as well as distinct transcriptional programs implicated in separate anatomic and functional GC compartments. Consistently, deletion of Ep300 but not Crebbp impaired the fitness of GC B cells in\u00a0vivo. Combined loss of Crebbp and Ep300 completely abrogated GC formation, suggesting that these proteins partially compensate for each other through common transcriptional targets. This synthetic lethal interaction was retained in CREBBP-mutant DLBCL cells and could be pharmacologically targeted with selective small molecule inhibitors of CREBBP and EP300 function. These data provide proof-of-principle for the clinical development of EP300-specific inhibitors in FL and DLBCL.",

      "abstract": "To repurpose compounds for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we screened a library of drugs and other targeted compounds approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on 9 cell lines and validated the results on a panel of 32 genetically characterized DLBCL cell lines. Dasatinib, a multikinase inhibitor, was effective against 50% of DLBCL cell lines, as well as against in vivo xenografts. Dasatinib was more broadly active than the Bruton kinase inhibitor ibrutinib and overcame ibrutinib resistance. Tumors exhibiting dasatinib resistance were commonly characterized by activation of the PI3K pathway and loss of PTEN expression as a specific biomarker. PI3K suppression by mTORC2 inhibition synergized with dasatinib and abolished resistance in vitro and in vivo. These results provide a proof of concept for the repurposing approach in DLBCL, and point to dasatinib as an attractive strategy for further clinical development in lymphomas.",

We demonstrate that Mef2b deletion reduces GC formation in mice and identify MEF2B transcriptional targets in GC, with roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, GC confinement, and differentiation. The most common lymphoma-associated MEF2B mutant (MEF2BD83V) is\u00a0hypomorphic, yet escapes binding and negative regulation by components of the HUCA complex and class\u00a0IIa HDACs. Mef2bD83V expression in mice leads to GC enlargement and lymphoma development, a phenotype that becomes fully penetrant in combination with BCL2 de-regulation, an event associated with human MEF2B mutations.

Over the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease, spurred by the implementation of powerful genomic technologies that enabled the definition of its genetic and epigenetic landscape. These studies have uncovered a multitude of genomic alterations that contribute to the initiation and maintenance of the tumor clone by disrupting biological functions known to be critical for the normal biology of its cells of origin, germinal center B cells. The identified alterations involve epigenetic remodeling, block of differentiation, escape from immune surveillance, and the constitutive activation of several signal transduction pathways. This wealth of new information offers unique opportunities for the development of improved diagnostic and prognostic tools that could help guide the clinical management of DLBCL patients. Furthermore, a number of the mutated genes identified are potentially actionable targets that are currently being explored for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes current knowledge of the most common genetic alterations associated with DLBCL in relation to their functional impact on the malignant transformation process, and discusses their clinical implications for mechanism-based therapeutics.",

However, the specific role of NOTCH1 in leukemogenesis remains to be established. Here, we report that the active intracellular portion of NOTCH1 (ICN1) is detectable in \u223c50% of peripheral blood CLL cases lacking gene mutations. We identify a \"NOTCH1 gene-expression signature\" in CLL cells, and show that this signature is significantly enriched in primary CLL cases expressing ICN1, independent of NOTCH1 mutation. NOTCH1 target genes include key regulators of B-cell proliferation, survival, and signal transduction. In particular, we show that NOTCH1 transactivates MYC via binding to B-cell-specific regulatory elements, thus implicating this oncogene in CLL development. These results significantly extend the role of NOTCH1 in CLL pathogenesis, and have direct implications for specific therapeutic targeting.",

      "abstract": "Inactivating mutations of the CREBBP acetyltransferase are highly frequent in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL), the two most common germinal center (GC)-derived cancers. However, the role of CREBBP inactivation in lymphomagenesis remains unclear. Here, we show that CREBBP regulates enhancer/super-enhancer networks with central roles in GC/post-GC cell fate decisions, including genes involved in signal transduction by the B-cell receptor and CD40 receptor, transcriptional control of GC and plasma cell development, and antigen presentation. Consistently, Crebbp-deficient B cells exhibit enhanced response to mitogenic stimuli and perturbed plasma cell differentiation. Although GC-specific loss of Crebbp was insufficient to initiate malignant transformation, compound Crebbp-haploinsufficient/BCL2-transgenic mice, mimicking the genetics of FL and DLBCL, develop clonal lymphomas recapitulating the features of the human diseases. These findings establish CREBBP as a haploinsufficient tumor-suppressor gene in GC B cells and provide insights into the mechanisms by which its loss contributes to lymphomagenesis.Significance: Loss-of-function mutations of CREBBP are common and early lesions in FL and DLBCL, suggesting a prominent role in lymphoma initiation. Our studies identify the cellular program by which reduced CREBBP dosage facilitates malignant transformation, and have direct implications for targeted lymphoma therapy based on drugs affecting CREBBP-mediated chromatin acetylation.

BCL6 protein stability is regulated by F-box protein 11 (FBXO11)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, which is impaired in \u223c6% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas that carry inactivating genetic alterations targeting the FBXO11 gene. In order to investigate the role of FBXO11 in vivo, we analyzed GC-specific FBXO11 knockout mice. FBXO11 reduction or loss led to an increased number of GC B cells, to an altered ratio of GC dark zone to light zone cells, and to higher levels of BCL6 protein in GC B cells. B-cell receptor-mediated degradation of BCL6 was reduced in the absence of FBXO11, suggesting that FBXO11 contributes to the physiologic downregulation of BCL6 at the end of the GC reaction. Finally, FBXO11 inactivation was associated with the development of lymphoproliferative disorders in mice.",

      "abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is one of the most common and aggressive types of B-cell lymphoma. Deregulation of proto-oncogene expression after a translocation, most notably to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus (IGH), is one of the hallmarks of DLBCL. Using whole-genome sequencing analysis, we have identified the PD-L1/PD-L2 locus as a recurrent translocation partner for IGH in DLBCL. PIM1 and TP63 were also identified as novel translocation partners for PD-L1/PD-L2 Fluorescence in situ hybridization was furthermore used to rapidly screen an expanded DLBCL cohort. Collectively, a subset of samples was found to be affected by gains (12%), amplifications (3%), and translocations (4%) of the PD-L1/PD-L2 locus. RNA sequencing data coupled with immunohistochemistry revealed that these cytogenetic alterations correlated with increased expression of PD-L1 but not of PD-L2 Moreover, cytogenetic alterations affecting the PD-L1/PD-L2 locus were more frequently observed in the non-germinal center B cell-like (non-GCB) subtype of DLBCL. These findings demonstrate the genetic basis of PD-L1 overexpression in DLBCL and suggest that treatments targeting the PD-1-PD-L1/PD-L2 axis might benefit DLBCL patients, especially those belonging to the more aggressive non-GCB subtype.",

In this study we show that FOXO1 transcription factor expression was restricted to the GC DZ and was required for DZ formation, since its absence in mice led to the loss of DZ gene programs and the formation of LZ-only GCs. FOXO1-negative GC B cells displayed normal somatic hypermutation but defective affinity maturation and class switch recombination. The function of FOXO1 in sustaining the DZ program involved the trans-activation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, and cooperation with the BCL6 transcription factor in the trans-repression of genes involved in immune activation, DNA repair, and plasma cell differentiation. These results also have implications for the role of FOXO1 in lymphomagenesis because they suggest that constitutive FOXO1 activity might be required for the oncogenic activity of deregulated BCL6 expression.",

      "abstract": "Mutations in the gene encoding the KMT2D (or MLL2) methyltransferase are highly recurrent and occur early during tumorigenesis in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). However, the functional consequences of these mutations and their role in lymphomagenesis are unknown. Here we show that FL- and DLBCL-associated KMT2D mutations impair KMT2D enzymatic activity, leading to diminished global H3K4 methylation in germinal-center (GC) B cells and DLBCL cells. Conditional deletion of Kmt2d early during B cell development, but not after initiation of the GC reaction, results in an increase in GC B cells and enhances B cell proliferation in mice. Moreover, genetic ablation of Kmt2d in mice overexpressing Bcl2 increases the incidence of GC-derived lymphomas resembling human tumors. These findings suggest that KMT2D acts as a tumor suppressor gene whose early loss facilitates lymphomagenesis by remodeling the epigenetic landscape of the cancer precursor cells. Eradication of KMT2D-deficient cells may thus represent a rational therapeutic approach for targeting early tumorigenic events. ",

      "abstract": "Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a complex disease comprising diverse subtypes and genetic profiles. Possibly because of the prevalence of genetic alterations activating canonical NF-\u03baB activity, a role for oncogenic lesions that activate the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway in DLBCL has remained elusive. Here, we show that deletion/mutation of TRAF3, a negative regulator of the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway, occurs in \u223c15% of DLBCLs and that it often coexists with BCL6 translocation, which prevents terminal B cell differentiation. Accordingly, in a mouse model constitutive activation of the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway cooperates with BCL6 deregulation in DLBCL development. This work demonstrates a key oncogenic role for the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway in DLBCL development.",

These studies uncovered the existence of several previously unappreciated alterations in key cellular pathways that may also influence treatment outcome. Indeed, a number of newly identified genetic lesions are currently being explored as markers for improved diagnosis and risk stratification, or are entering clinical trials as promising therapeutic targets.

By integrating transcriptome profiles with chromatin state maps, we have uncovered many previously unreported T-ALL-specific lncRNA genes, a fraction of which are directly controlled by the Notch1/Rpbj\u03ba activator complex. Finally we have shown that one specific Notch-regulated lncRNA, LUNAR1, is required for efficient T-ALL growth in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo due to its ability to enhance IGF1R mRNA expression and sustain IGF1 signaling. These results confirm that lncRNAs are important downstream targets of the Notch signaling pathway, and additionally they are key regulators of the oncogenic state in T-ALL. ",

      "abstract": "Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), which originates from germinal center (GC) B cells and harbors translocations deregulating v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC). A comparative analysis of microRNAs expressed in normal and malignant GC B cells identified microRNA 28 (miR-28) as significantly down-regulated in BL, as well as in other GC-derived B-NHL. We show that reexpression of miR-28 impairs cell proliferation and clonogenic properties of BL cells by modulating several targets including MAD2 mitotic arrest deficient-like 1, MAD2L1, a component of the spindle checkpoint whose down-regulation is essential in mediating miR-28-induced proliferation arrest, and BCL2-associated athanogene, BAG1, an activator of the ERK pathway. We identify the oncogene MYC as a negative regulator of miR-28 expression, suggesting that its deregulation by chromosomal translocation in BL leads to miR-28 suppression. In addition, we show that miR-28 can inhibit MYC-induced transformation by directly targeting genes up-regulated by MYC. Overall, our data suggest that miR-28 acts as a tumor suppressor in BL and that its repression by MYC contributes to B-cell lymphomagenesis. ",

The pathogenesis of this process remains largely unknown. Using whole-exome sequencing and copy-number analysis, we show here that the dominant clone of FL and transformed FL (tFL) arise by divergent evolution from a common mutated precursor through the acquisition of distinct genetic events. Mutations in epigenetic modifiers and antiapoptotic genes are introduced early in the common precursor, whereas tFL is specifically associated with alterations deregulating cell-cycle progression and DNA damage responses (CDKN2A/B, MYC, and TP53) as\u00a0well as aberrant somatic hypermutation. The genomic profile of tFL shares similarities with that of germinal center B cell-type de novo DLBCL but also displays unique combinations of altered genes with diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

      "abstract": "Richter syndrome (RS) derives from the rare transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) into an aggressive lymphoma, most commonly of the diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) type. The molecular pathogenesis of RS is only partially understood. By combining whole-exome sequencing and copy-number analysis of 9 CLL-RS pairs and of an extended panel of 43 RS cases, we show that this aggressive disease typically arises from the predominant CLL clone by acquiring an average of \u223c20 genetic lesions/case. RS lesions are heterogeneous in terms of load and spectrum among patients, and include those involved in CLL progression and chemorefractoriness (TP53 disruption and NOTCH1 activation) as well as some not previously implicated in CLL or RS pathogenesis. In particular, disruption of the CDKN2A/B cell cycle regulator is associated with \u223c30% of RS cases. Finally, we report that the genomic landscape of RS is significantly different from that of de novo DLBCL, suggesting that they represent distinct disease entities. These results provide insights into RS pathogenesis, and identify dysregulated pathways of potential diagnostic and therapeutic relevance. ",

Here we found that MEF2B directly activated the transcription of the proto-oncogene BCL6 in normal germinal-center (GC) B cells and was required for DLBCL proliferation. Mutation of MEF2B resulted in enhanced transcriptional activity of MEF2B either through disruption of its interaction with the corepressor CABIN1 or by rendering it insensitive to inhibitory signaling events mediated by phosphorylation and sumoylation. Consequently, the transcriptional activity of Bcl-6 was deregulated in DLBCLs with MEF2B mutations. Thus, somatic mutations of MEF2B may contribute to lymphomagenesis by deregulating BCL6 expression, and MEF2B may represent an alternative target for blocking Bcl-6 activity in DLBCLs. ",

Beyond the sheer numerical diversity of RNA species, recent studies have begun to uncover hints of even greater functional complexity. An increasing number of RNA molecules, including those from classic, well-studied classes, have been found to act in previously unanticipated regulatory roles, or as substrate for the biogenesis of functionally distinct RNA molecules, or both. Thus, these molecules can fulfill multiple, parallel functions, compounding the already rich landscape of RNA biology, and potentially connecting disparate biological regulatory networks in unexpected ways. In this article, we review recently discovered instances of RNA multifunctionality, with a particular focus on regulatory small RNAs.",

      "abstract": "Sequencing studies from several model systems have suggested that diverse and abundant small RNAs may be derived from tRNA, but the function of these molecules remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that one such tRNA-derived fragment, cloned from human mature B cells and designated CU1276, in fact possesses the functional characteristics of a microRNA, including a DICER1-dependent biogenesis, physical association with Argonaute proteins, and the ability to repress mRNA transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. Expression of CU1276 is abundant in normal germinal center B cells but absent in germinal center-derived lymphomas, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Furthermore, CU1276 represses endogenous RPA1, an essential gene involved in many aspects of DNA dynamics, and consequently, expression of this tRNA-derived microRNA in a lymphoma cell line suppresses proliferation and modulates the molecular response to DNA damage. These results establish that functionally active microRNAs can be derived from tRNA, thus defining a class of genetic entities with potentially important biological roles.",

Although substantial evidence indicates that BCL6 exerts its function by repressing the transcription of hundreds of protein-coding genes, its potential role in regulating gene expression via microRNAs (miRNAs) is not known. We have identified a core of 15 miRNAs that show binding of BCL6 in their genomic loci and are down-regulated in GC B cells. Among BCL6 validated targets, miR-155 and miR-361 directly modulate AID expression, indicating that via repression of these miRNAs, BCL6 up-regulates AID. Similarly, the expression of additional genes relevant for the GC phenotype, including SPI1, IRF8, and MYB, appears to be sustained via BCL6-mediated repression of miR-155. These findings identify a novel mechanism by which BCL6, in addition to repressing protein coding genes, promotes the expression of important GC functions by repressing specific miRNAs.",

Mutants with greater affinity for the antigen are positively selected in the light zone (LZ) to either differentiate into plasma and memory cells or reenter the DZ. The molecular circuits that govern positive selection in the GC are not known. We show here that the GC reaction required biphasic regulation of expression of the cell-cycle regulator c-Myc that involved its transient induction during early GC commitment, its repression by Bcl-6 in DZ B cells and its reinduction in B cells selected for reentry into the DZ. Inhibition of c-Myc in vivo led to GC collapse, which indicated an essential role for c-Myc in GCs. Our results have implications for the mechanism of GC selection and the role of c-Myc in lymphomagenesis.",

BCL6 prevents premature activation and differentiation of GC B cells and provides an environment tolerant of the DNA breaks associated with immunoglobulin gene remodeling mechanisms involved in the production of high-affinity antibodies of different isotypes. The critical functions exerted by BCL6 during normal B-cell development can be hijacked by the malignant transformation process. Indeed, BCL6 is targeted by genetic aberrations and acts as an oncogene in GC-derived lymphomas. The aberrations affecting BCL6 interfere with the multiple levels of regulation that grant a fine tuning of BCL6 expression and activity in physiologic conditions. This review summarizes the current knowledge on BCL6 function and its role in lymphomagenesis.",

      "abstract": "Deletion of chromosomal region 13q14 represents the most common genetic aberration in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). 13q14 deletions are commonly large and heterogeneous in size and affect multiple genes. We recently found that targeted deletion in mice of the 0.11 megabase (mb)-long minimal deleted region (MDR) encompassing the DLEU2/miR-15a/16-1 cluster recapitulates the spectrum of CLL-associated lymphoproliferations in humans, including CLL, CD5(+) monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, and CD5(-) non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In the present study, we demonstrate that additional deletion of the 0.69-mb large genomic region telomeric to the MDR called the common deleted region (CDR) changed the spectrum of lymphoproliferations developing in CDR- versus MDR-deleted mice in that the number of CLL among B-cell lymphoproliferations was significantly elevated in the former. In addition, CDR-deleted mice seemed to succumb to their disease faster than MDR-deleted mice. Comparing HCDR3 regions of CD5(+) lymphoproliferations derived from this and published CLL mouse models, 44% (29 of 66) of junctions could be assigned to 8 sets of highly similar HCDR3 regions, demonstrating that CLL developing in mice frequently expresses almost identical, stereotypic Ag receptors. These results suggest that the size of 13q14 deletions influences the phenotype of the developing lymphoproliferations and potentially the severity of disease, suggesting a tumor-suppressor function for genetic elements in addition to DLEU2/miR-15a/16-1.",

      "abstract": "We report that diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) commonly fails to express cell-surface molecules necessary for the recognition of tumor cells by immune-effector cells. In 29% of cases, mutations and deletions inactivate the \u03b22-Microglobulin gene, thus preventing the cell-surface expression of the HLA class-I (HLA-I) complex that is necessary for recognition by CD8(+) cytotoxic T\u00a0cells. In 21% of cases, analogous lesions\u00a0involve the CD58 gene, which encodes a molecule involved in T and natural killer cell-mediated responses. In addition to gene inactivation, alternative mechanisms lead to aberrant expression of HLA-I and CD58 in >60% of DLBCL. These two events are significantly associated in this disease, suggesting that they are coselected during lymphomagenesis for their combined role in escape from immune-surveillance.",

The full spectrum of genetic lesions that are present in the CLL genome, and therefore the number and identity of dysregulated cellular pathways, have not been identified. By combining next-generation sequencing and copy number analysis, we show here that the typical CLL coding genome contains <20 clonally represented gene alterations/case, including predominantly nonsilent mutations, and fewer copy number aberrations. These analyses led to the discovery of several genes not previously known to be altered in CLL. Although most of these genes were affected at low frequency in an expanded CLL screening cohort, mutational activation of NOTCH1, observed in 8.3% of CLL at diagnosis, was detected at significantly higher frequency during disease progression toward Richter transformation (31.0%), as well as in chemorefractory CLL (20.8%). Consistent with the association of NOTCH1 mutations with clinically aggressive forms of the disease, NOTCH1 activation at CLL diagnosis emerged as an independent predictor of poor survival. These results provide initial data on the complexity of the CLL coding genome and identify a dysregulated pathway of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.",

      "abstract": "B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma comprises biologically and clinically distinct diseases the pathogenesis of which is associated with genetic lesions affecting oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes. We report here that the two most common types--follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma--harbour frequent structural alterations inactivating CREBBP and, more rarely, EP300, two highly related histone and non-histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that act as transcriptional co-activators in multiple signalling pathways. Overall, about 39% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 41% of follicular lymphoma cases display genomic deletions and/or somatic mutations that remove or inactivate the HAT coding domain of these two genes. These lesions usually affect one allele, suggesting that reduction in HAT dosage is important for lymphomagenesis. We demonstrate specific defects in acetylation-mediated inactivation of the BCL6 oncoprotein and activation of the p53 tumour suppressor. These results identify CREBBP/EP300 mutations as a major pathogenetic mechanism shared by common forms of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with direct implications for the use of drugs targeting acetylation/deacetylation mechanisms.",

In this report we show that the BLIMP1/PRDM1 gene is inactivated by multiple mechanisms, including homozygous deletions, truncating or missense mutations, and transcriptional repression by constitutively active BCL6, in \u223c53% of ABC-DLBCL. In vivo, conditional deletion of Blimp1 in mouse B cells promotes the development of lymphoproliferative disorders recapitulating critical features of the human ABC-DLBCL.

      "abstract": "BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor required for mature B-cell germinal center (GC) formation and implicated in lymphomagenesis. BCL6's physiologic function is only partially known because the complete set of its targets in GC B cells has not been identified. To address this issue, we used an integrated biochemical-computational-functional approach to identify BCL6 direct targets in normal GC B cells. This approach includes (1) identification of BCL6-bound promoters by genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation, (2) inference of transcriptional relationships by the use of a regulatory network reverse engineering approach (ARACNe), and (3) validation of physiologic relevance of the candidate targets down-regulated in GC B cells. Our approach demonstrated that a large set of promoters (> 4000) is physically bound by BCL6 but that only a fraction of them is repressed in GC B cells. This set of 1207 targets identifies several cellular functions directly controlled by BCL6 during GC development, including activation, survival, DNA-damage response, cell cycle arrest, cytokine signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, and differentiation. These results define a broad role of BCL6 in preventing centroblasts from responding to signals leading to exit from the GC before they complete the phase of proliferative expansion and of antibody affinity maturation.",

Deletions of the chromosomal region 13q14 are commonly associated with CLL, with monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL), which occasionally precedes CLL, and with aggressive lymphoma, suggesting that this region contains a tumor-suppressor gene. Here, we demonstrate that deletion in mice of the 13q14-minimal deleted region (MDR), which encodes the DLEU2/miR-15a/16-1 cluster, causes development of indolent B cell-autonomous, clonal lymphoproliferative disorders, recapitulating the spectrum of CLL-associated phenotypes observed in humans. miR-15a/16-1-deletion accelerates the proliferation of both human and mouse B cells by modulating the expression of genes controlling cell-cycle progression. These results define the role of 13q14 deletions in the pathogenesis of CLL.",

      "abstract": "BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor which has emerged as a critical regulator of germinal centers (GC), the sites where B cells are selected based on the production of antibodies with high affinity for the antigen. BCL6 is also a frequently activated oncogene in the pathogenesis of human B cell lymphomas, most of which derive from the GC B cells. A thorough understanding of the biological role of BCL6 in normal B cell development and lymphomagenesis depends upon the identification of the full set of genes that are targets of its transcriptional regulatory function. Recently, the identification of BCL6 targets has been implemented with the use of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and gene expression profiling approaches. A large set of promoters have been shown to be physically bound by BCL6, but only a fraction of them appears to be subjected to transcriptional repression in GC B cells. This set of BCL6 targets points to a number of cellular functions which are likely to be directly controlled by BCL6 during GC development, including activation, survival, DNA-damage response, cell cycle arrest, cytokine-, toll-like receptor-, TGFbeta-, WNT-signaling, and differentiation. Overall, BCL6 is revealing its dual role of \"safe-keeper\" in preventing centroblasts from responding to signals leading to a premature exit from the GC and of contributor to lymphomagenesis by allowing the instauration of conditions favorable to malignant transformation.",

      "abstract": "S1P(2) sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor signaling can regulate proliferation, survival, morphology, and migration in many cell types in vitro. Here, we report that S1P(2)(-/-) mice develop clonal B-cell lymphomas with age, such that approximately half of the animals display this neoplasm by 1.5 to 2 years of age. Histologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular analyses revealed a uniform tumor phenotype with features of germinal center (GC)-derived diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Tumor formation was preceded by increases in GC B cells and CD69(+) T cells, as well as an increased formation of spontaneous GCs, suggesting that S1P(2) loss may promote lymphomagenesis in part by disrupting GC B-cells homeostasis. With the sole exception of rare lung tumors, the effect of S1P(2) gene disruption is remarkably restricted to DLBCL. In humans, 28 of 106 (26%) DLBCL samples were found to harbor multiple somatic mutations in the 5' sequences of the S1P(2) gene. Mutations displayed features resembling those generated by the IgV-associated somatic hypermutation mechanism, but were not detected at significant levels in normal GC B cells, indicating a tumor-associated aberrant function. Collectively, our data suggest that S1P(2) signaling may play a critical role in suppressing DLBCL formation in vivo. The high incidence of DLBCL in S1P(2)(-/-) mice, its onset at old age, and the relative lack of other neoplasms identify these mice as a novel, and potentially valuable, model for this highly prevalent and aggressive human malignancy.",

The biological function of BCL6 is only partially understood because no more than a few genes have been functionally characterized as direct targets of BCL6 transrepression activity. Here we report that the anti-apoptotic proto-oncogene BCL2 is a direct target of BCL6 in GC B cells. BCL6 binds to the BCL2 promoter region by interacting with the transcriptional activator Miz1 and suppresses Miz1-induced activation of BCL2 expression. BCL6-mediated suppression of BCL2 is lost in FL and DLBCL, where the 2 proteins are pathologically coexpressed, because of BCL2 chromosomal translocations and other mechanisms, including Miz1 deregulation and somatic mutations in the BCL2 promoter region. These results identify an important function for BCL6 in facilitating apoptosis of GC B cells via suppression of BCL2, and suggest that blocking this pathway is critical for lymphomagenesis.",

      "title": "Mutations of multiple genes cause deregulation of NF-kappaB in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma",
      "abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common form of lymphoma in adulthood, comprises multiple biologically and clinically distinct subtypes including germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. Gene expression profile studies have shown that its most aggressive subtype, ABC-DLBCL, is associated with constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB transcription complex. However, except for a small fraction of cases, it remains unclear whether NF-kappaB activation in these tumours represents an intrinsic program of the tumour cell of origin or a pathogenetic event. Here we show that >50% of ABC-DLBCL and a smaller fraction of GCB-DLBCL carry somatic mutations in multiple genes, including negative (TNFAIP3, also called A20) and positive (CARD11, TRAF2, TRAF5, MAP3K7 (TAK1) and TNFRSF11A (RANK)) regulators of NF-kappaB. Of these, the A20 gene, which encodes a ubiquitin-modifying enzyme involved in termination of NF-kappaB responses, is most commonly affected, with approximately 30% of patients displaying biallelic inactivation by mutations and/or deletions. When reintroduced in cell lines carrying biallelic inactivation of the gene, A20 induced apoptosis and cell growth arrest, indicating a tumour suppressor role. Less frequently, missense mutations of TRAF2 and CARD11 produce molecules with significantly enhanced ability to activate NF-kappaB. Thus, our results demonstrate that NF-kappaB activation in DLBCL is caused by genetic lesions affecting multiple genes, the loss or activation of which may promote lymphomagenesis by leading to abnormally prolonged NF-kappaB responses.",

Recently, homozygous deletions of the chromosomal band 6q23, involving the tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, A20) gene, a negative regulator of NF-kappaB, were described in ocular adnexal MZL, suggesting a role for A20 as a tumor suppressor in this disease. Here, we investigated inactivation of A20 by DNA mutations or deletions in a panel of extranodal MZL (EMZL), nodal MZL (NMZL), and splenic MZL (SMZL). Inactivating mutations encoding truncated A20 proteins were identified in 6 (19%) of 32 MZLs, including 2 (18%) of 11 EMZLs, 3 (33%) of 9 NMZLs, and 1 (8%) of 12 SMZLs. Two additional unmutated nonsplenic MZLs also showed monoallelic or biallelic A20 deletions by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or SNP-arrays. Thus, A20 inactivation by either somatic mutation and/or deletion represents a common genetic aberration across all MZL subtypes, which may contribute to lymphomagenesis by inducing constitutive NF-kappaB activation.",

A combination of cloning and computational analysis identified 178 miRNAs (miRNome) expressed in normal and/or transformed B cell libraries. Most notably, the B cell miRNome included 75 miRNAs which to our knowledge have not been previously reported and of which 66 have been validated by RNA blot and/or RT-PCR analyses. Numerous miRNAs were expressed in a stage- or transformation-specific fashion in B cells, suggesting specific functional or pathologic roles.

The pathogenesis of B-NHL is associated with distinct genetic lesions, including chromosomal translocations and aberrant SHM, which arise from mistakes occurring during CSR and SHM. A direct link between these DNA remodeling events and GC lymphoma development, however, has not been demonstrated. Here we have crossed three mouse models of B cell lymphoma driven by oncogenes (Myc, Bcl6 and Myc/Bcl6; refs. 5,6) with mice lacking activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), the enzyme required for both CSR and SHM. We show that AID deficiency prevents Bcl6-dependent, GC-derived B-NHL, but has no impact on Myc-driven, pre-GC lymphomas. Accordingly, abrogation of AID is associated with the disappearance of CSR- and SHM-mediated structural alterations. These results show that AID is required for GC-derived lymphomagenesis, supporting the notion that errors in AID-mediated antigen-receptor gene modification processes are principal contributors to the pathogenesis of human B-NHL.",

These events are associated with considerable genotoxic stress, which cells tolerate through suppression of DNA-damage responses by Bcl-6, a transcription factor required for the formation of germinal centers. Here we show that the expression of Bcl-6 is regulated by DNA damage through a signaling pathway that promotes Bcl-6 degradation. After DNA damage accumulated, the kinase ATM promoted Bcl-6 phosphorylation, leading to its interaction with the isomerase Pin1 and its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Because Bcl-6 is required for the maintenance of germinal centers, our findings suggest that the extent of genotoxic stress controls the fate of germinal center B cells by means of Bcl-6.",

Post-GC development of B cells requires BCL6 downregulation, while its constitutive expression caused by chromosomal translocations leads to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Herein we identify a signaling pathway that downregulates BCL6 expression in normal GC B cells and is blocked in a subset of DLBCL due to alterations in the BCL6 gene. Activation of the CD40 receptor leads to NF-kappaB-mediated induction of the IRF4 transcription factor, which, in turn, represses BCL6 expression by binding to its promoter region.

However, the biological functions required by c-Myc to induce oncogenesis remain elusive. Here we show that c-Myc has a direct role in the control of DNA replication. c-Myc interacts with the pre-replicative complex and localizes to early sites of DNA synthesis. Depletion of c-Myc from mammalian (human and mouse) cells as well as from Xenopus cell-free extracts, which are devoid of RNA transcription, demonstrates a non-transcriptional role for c-Myc in the initiation of DNA replication. Overexpression of c-Myc causes increased replication origin activity with subsequent DNA damage and checkpoint activation. These findings identify a critical function of c-Myc in DNA replication and suggest a novel mechanism for its normal and oncogenic functions.",

Plasma cell differentiation required IRF4 as well as the transcriptional repressor Blimp-1, which both acted 'upstream' of the transcription factor XBP-1. In addition, IRF4-deficient B cells had impaired expression of activation-induced deaminase and lacked class-switch recombination, suggesting an independent function for IRF4 in this process.

The BLIMP1 locus lies on chromosome 6q21-q22.1, a region frequently deleted in B cell lymphomas, suggesting that it may harbor a tumor suppressor gene. We report here that the BLIMP1 gene is inactivated by structural alterations in 24% (8 out of 34) activated B cell-like diffuse large cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL), but not in GC B cell-like (n = 0/37) or unclassified (n = 0/21) DLBCL. BLIMP1 alterations included gene truncations, nonsense mutations, frameshift deletions, and splice site mutations that generate aberrant transcripts encoding truncated BLIMP1 proteins. In all cases studied, both BLIMP1 alleles were inactivated by deletions or mutations. Furthermore, most non-GC type DLBCL cases (n = 20/26, 77%) lack BLIMP1 protein expression, despite the presence of BLIMP1 mRNA. These results indicate that a sizable fraction of ABC-DLBCL carry an inactive BLIMP1 gene, and suggest that the same gene is inactivated by epigenetic mechanisms in an additional large number of cases. These findings point to a role for BLIMP1 as a tumor suppressor gene, whose inactivation may contribute to lymphomagenesis by blocking post-GC differentiation of B cells toward plasma cells.",

      "abstract": "During humoral immune responses, two distinct genetic modification events diversify the Ig genes in germinal center (GC) B cells: somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination (CSR). Both processes require the activity of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), an enzyme expressed specifically in GC B cells. However, the mechanisms that regulate AID activity are largely unknown. Here we report that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates AID and regulates its activity in GC B cells. AID physically interacts with the PKA holoenzyme in the cytoplasm and is phosphorylated by the PKA catalytic subunit at specific residues. AID phosphorylation is required for CSR, because substitution of the two phosphorylation targets impairs its ability to rescue CSR in AID-deficient B cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of PKA prevents isotype class switching in a murine B-cell lymphoma cell line; conversely, B cells from mice where PKA activity is made constitutive by conditional deletion of the PKA regulatory subunit gene display enhanced CSR. These findings implicate PKA in the regulation of AID function and suggest that the control of T cell-dependent immune responses may be modulated, via AID, by signals that activate PKA.",

BCL6 interacted with the transcriptional activator Miz-1 and, via Miz-1, bound to the promoter and suppressed transcription of the cell cycle arrest gene CDKN1A. Through this mechanism, BCL6 may facilitate the proliferative expansion of germinal centers during the normal immune response and, when deregulated, the pathological expansion of B cell lymphomas.",

These mice display increased GC formation and perturbed post-GC differentiation characterized by a decreased number of post-isotype switch plasma cells. Subsequently, these mice develop a lymphoproliferative syndrome that culminates with the development of lymphomas displaying features typical of human DLBCL. These results define the oncogenic role of BCL6 in the pathogenesis of DLBCL and provide a faithful mouse model of this common disease.",

The results are suggestive a hierarchical, scale-free network, where a few highly interconnected genes (hubs) account for most of the interactions. Validation of the network against available data led to the identification of MYC as a major hub, which controls a network comprising known target genes as well as new ones, which were biochemically validated. The newly identified MYC targets include some major hubs. This approach can be generally useful for the analysis of normal and pathologic networks in mammalian cells.",

      "abstract": "For many decades, B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) stood out as a B cell-derived malignancy that was difficult to position within the framework of the available B cell differentiation scheme: First, the histology as well as the immunophenotype did not quite resemble that of any normal lymphocyte; second, in contrast to almost all other B cell tumor subtypes, the immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) genes of B-CLL cases could be either unmutated or somatically mutated; third, the genomic lesions observed in B-CLL were markedly distinct from those of the other major B cell malignancies, which typically exhibit balanced chromosome translocations. Recent advances in the characterization of both B-CLL and normal B cell subpopulations by phenotypic analysis, global gene expression profiling, as well as extensive IgV gene repertoire analyses have shed new light on the phenotype and the cell derivation of B-CLL and provided novel hypotheses concerning its pathogenesis. Here we summarize recent work relevant to these issues and conclude that B-CLL may be derived from a cell that can be referred to as a marginal zone B cell. Moreover, we propose that the lack of chromosomal translocations in B-CLL may be related to their derivation from marginal zone B cells, since somatic hypermutation and Ig class switch, the processes that generate chromosome translocations in most germinal center (GC)-derived malignancies, are no longer active in marginal zone B cells. Also, we discuss similarities and differences between B-CLL and hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and suggest that also HCL may be derived from a post-GC memory or marginal zone B cell.",

However, it is not fully understood at which stages of B-cell development the CD40 pathway is activated in vivo. To address this question, we induced CD40 signaling in human transformed GC B cells in vitro and identified a CD40 gene expression signature by DNA microarray analysis. This signature was then investigated in the gene expression profiles of normal B cells and found in pre- and post-GC B cells (naive and memory) but, surprisingly, not in GC B cells. This finding was validated in lymphoid tissues by showing that the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factors, which translocate to the nucleus upon CD40 stimulation, are retained in the cytoplasm in most GC B cells, indicating the absence of CD40 signaling. Nevertheless, a subset of centrocytes and B cells in the subepithelium showed nuclear staining of multiple NF-kappaB subunits, suggesting that a fraction of naive and memory B cells may be subject to CD40 signaling or to other signals that activate NF-kappaB. Together, these results show that GC expansion occurs in the absence of CD40 signaling, which may act only in the initial and final stages of the GC reaction.",

The precise function of BCL6 in germinal-centre development and lymphomagenesis is unclear because very few direct BCL6 target genes have been identified. Here we report that BCL6 suppresses the expression of the p53 (also known as tp53) tumour suppressor gene and modulates DNA damage-induced apoptotic responses in germinal-centre B cells. BCL6 represses p53 transcription by binding two specific DNA sites within the p53 promoter region and, accordingly, p53 expression is absent in germinal-centre B cells where BCL6 is highly expressed. Suppression of BCL6 expression via specific short interfering RNA leads to increased levels of p53 messenger RNA and protein both under basal conditions and in response to DNA damage. Most notably, constitutive expression of BCL6 protects B cell lines from apoptosis induced by DNA damage. These results suggest that an important function of BCL6 is to allow germinal-centre B cells to tolerate the physiological DNA breaks required for immunoglobulin class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation without inducing a p53-dependent apoptotic response. These findings also imply that deregulated BCL6 expression contributes to lymphomagenesis in part by functional inactivation of p53.",

      "title": "Expression of the AID protein in normal and neoplastic B cells",
      "abstract": "Somatic hypermutation (SHM) targets primarily the immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) genes in germinal center (GC) B cells, thereby allowing antibody affinity maturation. A malfunction of SHM, termed aberrant somatic hypermutation (ASHM), was found in about 50% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), leading to mutations in the 5' sequences of multiple genes, including oncogenes. Although the SHM mechanism is largely unknown, it was shown to require the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene. AID mRNA is expressed in GC B cells and GC-derived lymphomas, but the pattern of expression of the AID protein is not known. Using 2 specific antibodies, here we show that the AID protein can be detected in GC centroblasts and their transformed counterpart (Burkitt lymphoma) but not in pre-GC B cells and post-GC neoplasms, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. DLBCLs displayed variable levels of AID expression, which did not correlate with IgV ongoing hypermutation, ASHM, or disease subtype. Finally, both in normal and malignant B cells the AID protein appeared predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that the AID protein is specifically expressed in normal and transformed GC B cells; nonetheless, its predominantly cytoplasmic localization suggests that additional mechanisms may regulate its function and may be altered during lymphomagenesis.",

      "title": "Aberrant somatic hypermutation in multiple subtypes of AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma",
      "abstract": "The pathogenesis of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphomas (AIDS-NHLs) is associated with chromosomal translocations that deregulate the expression of various oncogenes. Recently, a novel mechanism of genetic lesion, termed aberrant hypermutation, has been identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of immunocompetent hosts. In these tumors, the somatic hypermutation (SHM) process that normally targets immunoglobulin V (IgV) genes in B cells appears to misfire and causes mutations in the 5' sequences of multiple proto-oncogenes, including PIM-1, PAX-5, RhoH/TTF, and c-MYC. To investigate whether aberrant hypermutation occurs also in AIDS-NHL, we studied the mutation profile of these 4 genes in various histologic subtypes. Mutations in 1 gene or more were detected in 19 of 39 (48.7%) AIDS-NHL cases (10 of 18 AIDS-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; 4 of 11 AIDS-Burkitt lymphoma; 4 of 6 AIDS-primary effusion lymphoma; 1 of 4 AIDS-primary central nervous system lymphoma), with 9 of 39 (23.1%) cases carrying mutations in 2 or more genes. Overall, PIM-1 was mutated in 5 of 39 (12.8%), PAX-5 in 8 of 39 (20.5%), RhoH/TTF in 9 of 39 (23.1%), and c-MYC in 7 of 27 (25.9%) AIDS-NHL cases. Mutations were represented mainly by single base pair substitutions (n = 63) with rare deletions/insertions (n = 5) and displayed features typical of the IgV-associated SHM process. In addition, a number of mutations in PIM-1 and c-MYC were found to affect coding exons, leading to amino acid substitutions with likely functional consequences. Analysis of intraclonal heterogeneity documented that the aberrant hypermutation activity may be ongoing in at least some cases. These data indicate that aberrant hypermutation is associated with various subtypes of AIDS-NHL and may represent a major contributor to their pathogenesis.",

      "abstract": "The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor required for the development of germinal centers (GCs) and implicated in the pathogenesis of GC-derived B cell lymphoma. Understanding the precise role of BCL6 in normal GC formation and in lymphomagenesis depends on the identification of genes that are direct targets of its transcriptional repression. Here we report that BCL6 directly controls the expression of B7-1/CD80, a costimulatory receptor involved in B-T cell interactions critical for the development of T cell-mediated antibody responses. Upon CD40 signaling, transcription of the CD80 gene is induced by the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB transcription factor. Our results show that BCL6 prevents CD40-induced expression of CD80 by binding its promoter region in vivo and suppressing its transcriptional activation by NF-kappaB. Consistent with a physiologic role for BCL6 in suppressing CD80, the expression of these two genes is mutually exclusive in B cells, and BCL6-defective mice show increased expression of CD80 in B cells. The results suggest that BCL6 may directly control the ability of B cell to interact with T cells during normal GC development. In addition, these findings imply that T-B cell interactions may be disrupted in B cell lymphoma expressing deregulated BCL6 genes.",

Here we used gene expression profile analysis (about 12 000 genes) to further define the phenotype of PEL and to investigate the lymphoma relationship to normal B cells and to other tumor subtypes, including non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) of immunocompetent hosts and AIDS-associated NHL (AIDS-NHL). The results showed that PEL displayed a common gene expression profile that is clearly distinct from all NHLs of immunocompetent hosts and AIDS-NHL subtypes and, in contrast to those, is not related to germinal center (GC) or memory B cells. The gene expression profile of PEL was defined as plasmablastic because it showed features of both immunoblasts identified by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and AIDS immunoblastic lymphoma, and plasma cells, as defined by multiple myeloma cell lines. Finally, our results identify a set of genes specifically expressed in PEL tumor cells. Their expression was validated at the protein level, suggesting their potential pathogenetic and clinical significance.",

The BCL6 regulatory sequences are also targeted by somatic hypermutation in germinal center (GC) B cells and in a fraction of all GC-derived lymphomas. However, the functional consequences of these mutations are unknown. Here we report that a subset of mutations specifically associated with DLBCL causes deregulated BCL6 transcription. These mutations affect 2 adjacent BCL6 binding sites located within the first noncoding exon of the gene, and they prevent BCL6 from binding its own promoter, thereby disrupting its negative autoregulatory circuit. These alterations were found in approximately 16% of DLBCLs devoid of chromosomal translocations involving the BCL6 locus, but they were not found in normal GC B cells. This study establishes a novel mechanism for BCL6 deregulation and reveals a broader involvement of this gene in DLBCL pathogenesis.",

      "abstract": "The germinal center (GC) reaction in T cell dependent antibody responses is crucial for the generation of B cell memory and plays a critical role in B cell lymphomagenesis. To gain insight into the physiology of this reaction, we identified the transcriptional changes that occur in B cells during the GC-transit (na\u00efve B cells --> CD77(+) centroblasts (CBs) --> CD77(-) centrocytes (CCs) --> memory B cells) by DNA microarray experiments and the subsequent data analysis employing unsupervised and supervised hierarchical clustering. The na\u00efve B cell is characterized by a nonproliferative, anti-apoptotic phenotype and the expression of various chemokine and cytokine receptors. The transition from na\u00efve B cells to CBs is associated with (1) the up-regulation of genes associated with cellular proliferation, DNA-repair, and chromatin remodeling; (2) the acquisition of a pro-apoptotic phenotype; (3) the down-regulation of cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion receptors expressed in the na\u00efve cells; and (4) the expression of a distinct adhesion repertoire. The CB and the CC revealed surprisingly few gene expression differences, suggesting that the CC is heterogeneous in its cellular composition. The CB/CC to memory B cell transition shows a general reversion to the profile characteristic for the na\u00efve B cells, with the exception of the up-regulation of several surface receptors, including CD27, CD80, and IL-2Rbeta, and the simultaneous expression of both anti- and pro-apoptotic genes. These gene expression profiles of the normal B cell subpopulations are being used to identify the signals occurring during GC development, the cellular derivation of various types of B cell malignancies, and the genes deregulated in GC-derived tumors.",

      "abstract": "Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) form a heterogeneous group of diseases, with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) comprising the largest subgroup. The commonest chromosomal translocations found in DLBCL are those affecting band 3q27. In 35% of DLBCL cases, as well as in a small fraction of follicular lymphomas, the normal transcriptional regulation of Bcl-6 is disrupted by these chromosomal translocations. In addition, about three-quarters of cases of DLBCL display multiple somatic mutations in the 5' non-coding region of Bcl-6, which occur independently of chromosomal translocations and appear to be due to the IgV-associated somatic hypermutation process. Bcl-6 is a 95-kD nuclear phosphoprotein belonging to the BTB/POZ (bric-a-brac, tramtrack, broad complex/Pox virus zinc finger) zinc finger family of transcription factors. It has been suggested that Bcl-6 is important in the repression of genes involved in the control of lymphocyte activation, differentiation, and apoptosis within the germinal center, and that its down-regulation is necessary for normal B-cells to exit the germinal center. Bcl-6 remains constitutively expressed in a substantial proportion of B-cell lymphomas. Recently, acetylation has been identified as a mode for down-regulating Bcl-6 activity by inhibition of the ability of Bcl-6 to recruit complexes containing histone deacetylases (HDAC). The pharmacologic inhibition of two recently identified deacetylation pathways, HDAC- and silent information regulator (SIR)-2-dependent deacetylation, results in the accumulation of inactive acetylated Bcl-6 and thus in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in B-cell lymphoma cells. These results reveal a new method of regulating Bcl-6, with the potential for therapeutic exploitation. These studies also indicate a novel mechanism by which acetylation promotes transcription, not only by modifying histones and activating transcriptional activators, but also by inhibiting transcriptional repressors.",

Here we show that the co-activator p300 binds and acetylates BCL6 in vivo and inhibits its function. Acetylation disrupts the ability of BCL6 to recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs), thereby hindering its capacity to repress transcription and to induce cell transformation. BCL6 is acetylated under physiologic conditions in normal germinal-center B cells and in germinal center-derived B-cell tumors. Treatment with specific inhibitors shows that levels of acetylation of BCL6 are controlled by both HDAC-dependent and SIR2-dependent pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of these pathways leads to the accumulation of the inactive acetylated BCL6 and to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in B-cell lymphoma cells. These results identify a new mechanism of regulation of the proto-oncogene BCL6 with potential for therapeutic exploitation. Furthermore, these findings provide a new mechanism by which acetylation can promote transcription not only by modifying histones and activating transcriptional activators, but also by inhibiting transcriptional repressors.",

Constitutive expression of PKA-Cbeta in Rat1A cells induces their transformation, and c-MYC-induced transformation can be reverted by pharmacological inhibition of PKA, suggesting that up-regulation of PKA is critical for c-MYC-associated tumorigenesis.

      "abstract": "Chromosomal translocations involving band 3q27 with various different partner chromosomes represent a recurrent cytogenetic abnormality in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In a fraction of these translocations, the chromosomal breakpoint is located within the 5' noncoding region of the BCL-6 proto-oncogene where the BCL-6 major breakpoint region (MBR) maps. As a result of the translocation, BCL-6 expression is deregulated by promoter substitution. However, between 30 and 50% of lymphomas with cytogenetically detectable translocations affecting band 3q27 retain a germ-line configuration at the BCL-6 locus. To identify possible additional breakpoint clusters within 3q27, we cloned a t(3;14)(q27;q32) lymphoma without MBR rearrangement and found a novel breakpoint site located between 245 and 285 kb 5' to BCL-6. Breakpoints within this newly described region, which we called the alternative breakpoint region (ABR), were found to be recurrent in lymphomas carrying t(3q27) chromosomal translocations but devoid of BCL-6 MBR rearrangements. Comparative analysis of multiple lymphomas carrying rearrangements within the ABR showed that the breakpoints cluster within a 20-kb distance. Translocations involving the ABR may juxtapose BCL-6 to distantly acting, heterologous transcriptional regulatory elements which cause deregulation of the proto-oncogene. The identification of BCL-6 ABR provides new tools for the diagnosis of lymphomas carrying aberrations at 3q27 and deregulated BCL-6 genes.",

      "abstract": "B cell-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) represents a common malignancy whose cell derivation and pathogenesis are unknown. Recent studies have shown that >50% of CLLs display hypermutated immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) sequences and a more favorable prognosis, suggesting that they may represent a distinct subset of CLLs which have transited through germinal centers (GCs), the physiologic site of IgV hypermutation. To further investigate the phenotype of CLLs, their cellular derivation and their relationship to normal B cells, we have analyzed their gene expression profiles using oligonucleotide-based DNA chip microarrays representative of approximately 12,000 genes. The results show that CLLs display a common and characteristic gene expression profile that is largely independent of their IgV genotype. Nevertheless, a restricted number of genes (<30) have been identified whose differential expression can distinguish IgV mutated versus unmutated cases and identify them in independent panels of cases. Comparison of CLL profiles with those of purified normal B cell subpopulations indicates that the common CLL profile is more related to memory B cells than to those derived from naive B cells, CD5(+) B cells, and GC centroblasts and centrocytes. Finally, this analysis has identified a subset of genes specifically expressed by CLL cells of potential pathogenetic and clinical relevance.",

      "title": "Hypermutation of multiple proto-oncogenes in B-cell diffuse large-cell lymphomas",
      "abstract": "Genomic instability promotes tumorigenesis and can occur through various mechanisms, including defective segregation of chromosomes or inactivation of DNA mismatch repair. Although B-cell lymphomas are associated with chromosomal translocations that deregulate oncogene expression, a mechanism for genome-wide instability during lymphomagenesis has not been described. During B-cell development, the immunoglobulin variable (V) region genes are subject to somatic hypermutation in germinal-centre B cells. Here we report that an aberrant hypermutation activity targets multiple loci, including the proto-oncogenes PIM1, MYC, RhoH/TTF (ARHH) and PAX5, in more than 50% of diffuse large-cell lymphomas (DLCLs), which are tumours derived from germinal centres. Mutations are distributed in the 5' untranslated or coding sequences, are independent of chromosomal translocations, and share features typical of V-region-associated somatic hypermutation. In contrast to mutations in V regions, however, these mutations are not detectable in normal germinal-centre B cells or in other germinal-centre-derived lymphomas, suggesting a DLCL-associated malfunction of somatic hypermutation. Intriguingly, the four hypermutable genes are susceptible to chromosomal translocations in the same region, consistent with a role for hypermutation in generating translocations by DNA double-strand breaks. By mutating multiple genes, and possibly by favouring chromosomal translocations, aberrant hypermutation may represent the major contributor to lymphomagenesis.",

A gene was cloned from chromosomal translocations affecting band 3q27, which are common in DLCL. This gene, BCL-6, codes for a 79-kilodalton protein that is homologous with zinc finger-transcription factors. In 33 percent (13 of 39) of DLCL samples, but not in other types of lymphoid malignancies, the BCL-6 gene is truncated within its 5' noncoding sequences, suggesting that its expression is deregulated. Thus, BCL-6 may be a proto-oncogene specifically involved in the pathogenesis of DLCL.",

      "title": "Identification of reciprocal translocation sites within the c-myc oncogene and immunoglobulin mu locus in a Burkitt lymphoma",
      "abstract": "The association between certain human tumours and characteristic chromosomal abnormalities has led to the hypothesis that specific cellular oncogenes may be involved and consequently 'activated' in these genetic recombinations. This hypothesis has found strong support in the recent findings that some cellular homologues of retroviral onc genes are located in chromosomal segments which are affected by specific tumour-related abnormalities (see ref. 4 for review). In the case of human undifferentiated B-cell lymphoma (UBL) and mouse plasmacytomas, cytogenetic and chromosomal mapping data have identified characteristic chromosomal recombinations directly involving different immunoglobulin genes and the c-myc oncogene (for review see refs 5, 6). In UBLs carrying the t(8:14) translocation it has been shown that the human c-myc gene is located on the region of chromosome 8 (8q24) which is translocated to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus (IHC) on chromosome 14. Although it is known that the chromosomal breakpoints can be variably located within or outside the c-myc locus and within the IHC mu (refs 9, 11) or IHC gamma locus, the recombination sites have not been exactly identified and mapped in relation to the functional domains of these loci. We report here the identification and characterization of two reciprocal recombination sites between c-myc and IHC mu in a Burkitt lymphoma. Nucleotide sequencing of the cross-over point joining chromosomes 8 and 14 on chromosome 14q--shows that the onc gene is interrupted within its first intron and joined to the heavy-chain mu switch region. This recombination predicts that the translocated onc gene would code for a rearranged mRNA but a normal c-myc polypeptide.",
