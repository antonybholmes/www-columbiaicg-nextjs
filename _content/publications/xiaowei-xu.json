      "title": "Efficient and strand-specific profiling of replicating chromatin with enrichment and sequencing of protein-associated nascent DNA in mammalian cells",
      "abstract": "Faithful duplication of both genetic and epigenetic information is essential for all eukaryotic cells. DNA replication initiates from replication origins and proceeds bidirectionally but asymmetrically, with the leading strand being synthesized continuously and the lagging strand discontinuously as Okazaki fragments by distinct DNA polymerases. Unraveling the underlying mechanisms of chromatin replication at both strands is crucial to better understand DNA replication and its coupled processes, including nucleosome assembly, sister chromatid cohesion and DNA mismatch repair. Here we describe the enrichment and sequencing of protein-associated nascent DNA (eSPAN) method to analyze the enrichment of proteins of interest, including histones and their modifications at replicating chromatin in a strand-specific manner in mammalian cells. Briefly, cells are pulsed with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine to label newly synthesized DNA. After cell permeabilization, the target proteins are sequentially bound by antibodies and protein A-fused transposase, which digests and tags genomic DNA of interest once activated by magnesium. The strand specificity is preserved through oligo-replacement. Finally, the resulting double-strand DNA is denatured and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against bromodeoxyuridine to enrich nascent DNA associated with proteins of interest. After PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing, the mapped reads are used to calculate the relative enrichment of the target proteins around replication origins. Compared with alternative methods, the eSPAN protocol is simple, cost-effective and sensitive, even in a relatively small number of mammalian cells. The whole procedures from cell collection to generation of sequencing-ready libraries can be completed in 2 days.",

      "title": "DNA polymerase \u03b1 interacts with H3-H4 and facilitates the transfer of parental histones to lagging strands",
      "abstract": "How parental histones, the carriers of epigenetic modifications, are deposited onto replicating DNA remains poorly understood. Here, we describe the eSPAN method (enrichment and sequencing of protein-associated nascent DNA) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and use it to detect histone deposition onto replicating DNA strands with a relatively small number of cells. We show that DNA polymerase \u03b1 (Pol \u03b1), which synthesizes short primers for DNA synthesis, binds histone H3-H4 preferentially. A Pol \u03b1 mutant defective in histone binding in vitro impairs the transfer of parental H3-H4 to lagging strands in both yeast and mouse ES cells. Last, dysregulation of both coding genes and noncoding endogenous retroviruses is detected in mutant ES cells defective in parental histone transfer. Together, we report an efficient eSPAN method for analysis of DNA replication-linked processes in mouse ES cells and reveal the mechanism of Pol \u03b1 in parental histone transfer.",

      "title": "SIRT7 activates p53 by enhancing PCAF-mediated MDM2 degradation to arrest the cell cycle",
      "abstract": "Sirtuin 7 (SIRT7), an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, plays vital roles in energy sensing, but the underlying mechanisms of action remain less clear. Here, we report that SIRT7 is required for p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest during glucose deprivation. We show that SIRT7 directly interacts with p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and the affinity for this interaction increases during glucose deprivation. Upon binding, SIRT7 deacetylates PCAF at lysine 720 (K720), which augments PCAF binding to murine double minute (MDM2), the p53 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to accelerated MDM2 degradation. This effect results in upregulated expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor, p21Waf1/Cip1, which further leads to cell-cycle arrest and decreased cell viability. These data highlight the importance of the SIRT7-PCAF interaction in regulating p53 activity and cell-cycle progression during conditions of glucose deprivation. This axis may represent a new avenue to design effective therapeutics based on tumor starvation.",

      "title": "Chromatin Assembly Factor 1 (CAF-1) facilitates the establishment of facultative heterochromatin during pluripotency exit",
      "abstract": "Establishment and subsequent maintenance of distinct chromatin domains during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation are crucial for lineage specification and cell fate determination. Here we show that the histone chaperone Chromatin Assembly Factor 1 (CAF-1), which is recruited to DNA replication forks through its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) for nucleosome assembly, participates in the establishment of H3K27me3-mediated silencing during differentiation. Deletion of CAF-1 p150 subunit impairs the silencing of many genes including Oct4,\u00a0Sox2 and Nanog as well as the establishment of H3K27me3 at these gene promoters during ESC differentiation. Mutations of PCNA residues involved in recruiting CAF-1 to the chromatin also result in defects in differentiation in vitro and impair early embryonic development as p150 deletion. Together, these results reveal that the CAF-1-PCNA nucleosome assembly pathway plays an important role in the establishment of H3K27me3-mediated silencing during cell fate determination.",
