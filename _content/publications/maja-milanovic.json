      "title": "FATC Domain Deletion Compromises ATM Protein Stability, Blocks Lymphocyte Development, and Promotes Lymphomagenesis",
      "abstract": "Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase is a master regulator of the DNA damage response, and loss of ATM leads to primary immunodeficiency and greatly increased risk for lymphoid malignancies. The FATC domain is conserved in phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-related protein kinases (PIKKs). Truncation mutation in the FATC domain (R3047X) selectively compromised reactive oxygen species-induced ATM activation in cell-free assays. In this article, we show that in mouse models, knock-in ATM-R3057X mutation (Atm\u2060 \nRX\n \u2060, corresponding to R3047X in human ATM) severely compromises ATM protein stability and causes T cell developmental defects, B cell Ig class-switch recombination defects, and infertility resembling ATM-null. The residual ATM-R3057X protein retains minimal yet functional measurable DNA damage-induced checkpoint activation and significantly delays lymphomagenesis in Atm\u2060 \nRX/RX\n \u2060 mice compared with Atm\u2060 \n-/-\n \u2060. Together, these results support a physiological role of the FATC domain in ATM protein stability and show that the presence of minimal residual ATM-R3057X protein can prevent growth retardation and delay tumorigenesis without restoring lymphocyte development and fertility.",

      "title": "The Cancer-Associated ATM R3008H Mutation Reveals the Link between ATM Activation and Its Exchange",
      "abstract": "ATM kinase is a tumor suppressor and a master regulator of the DNA damage response. Most cancer-associated alterations to ATM are missense mutations at the PI3-kinase regulatory domain (PRD) or the kinase domain. Expression of kinase-dead (KD) ATM protein solely accelerates lymphomagenesis beyond ATM loss. To understand how PRD suppresses lymphomagenesis, we introduced the cancer-associated PRD mutation R3008H (R3016 in mouse) into mice. R3008H abrogated DNA damage- and oxidative stress-induced activation of ATM without consistently affecting ATM protein stability and recruitment. In contrast to the early embryonic lethality of AtmKD/KD mice, AtmR3016H (AtmR/R ) mice were viable, immunodeficient, and displayed spontaneous craniofacial abnormalities and delayed lymphomagenesis compared with Atm-/- controls. Mechanistically, R3008H rescued the tardy exchange of ATM-KD at DNA damage foci, indicating that PRD coordinates ATM activation with its exchange at DNA-breaks. Taken together, our results reveal a unique tumorigenesis profile for PRD mutations that is distinct from null or KD mutations. SIGNIFICANT: This study functionally characterizes the most common ATM missense mutation R3008H in cancer and identifies a unique role of PI3-kinase regulatory domain in ATM activation.",
